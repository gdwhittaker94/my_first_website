                            	So more or less I've been in this business of web development and coding/programming for about three months now. What do I have to show for it? Well, I have this website for one. But also I have been keeping track of the journey so far via photos and videos and making copious notes.
                           		<br><br>
                           		What you see here is the progress I made within the first two months of learning web development (from the beginning of May to the end of June). After that (during July) I've been working solely on this website.
								<br><br>
								I want to share these things with you so that you, as well as I, can see how I am progressing as time goes on. Maybe this will serve as a reference for other people who are looking to learn coding and give them an idea of how long it takes or what's involved. Maybe some people may just find it interesting. Whatever the case, here is a visual journey of my progress so far...

								What this image shows is the first bit of actual coding I ever did (in a simple text editor on my laptop). The classic 'Hello world!' message on a white page. It seems like nothing, but I remember being enthralled by the seemingly magical appearance of this text on blank web browser page. The idea was to start creating a very simple web page.</td>

								Above you can see that same basic web page, but with added text using the paragraph and heading elements and also some images sourced from the web. I also learnt about some basic CSS styling, adding colours to the text, the web page background, and also about sizing images.
								<br><br>
								In the video to right you can see how I learnt to make the web page responsive (in a basic way) so that the images and text change size as the size of the web browser changes.
								<br><br>
								Finally below you can see when I learnt about the text-alignment attribute in CSS, changing the font style, and how to alter the position of HTML elements on a web page. The picture below to the right shows the code for this simple web page. At the time I thought that was a lot and was pretty proud of myself.

						   	 	While I was creating a basic web page and playing around with HTML and CSS in a simple text editor, I was also making copious notes and trying to take in everything I could about this new world.

								In this video on the left you can see evidence of this, with the final document that you see being the set up for the next video below which was my first 'solo' project.

						   	 	After creating two basic web pages we moved on to creating a <i>website.</i> Here you can see when I made my first hyperlinks. This was really exciting stuff! Finally I was fully unlocking the power of the internet - being able to hop from one virtual place to another, instantly. Not only that, but I moved from using a basic text editor to Microsoft Studio Visual Code: a professional and industry standard text editor program. Everything was a lot quicker and easier to do now.
								<br><br>
								Below you can see how the code for this website developed and also the result of that code. I started learning about HTML comments and div elements. The idea was to make a simple website called 'Code Club' for a local Code/Programming group.

								Here you can see a jump in my learning progress. Instead of using 'inline' CSS styling, I started using an 'internal' styling which is where all the styling rules are put to the top of the HTML document and linked to the elements down below. Also, I was introduced to the Google Developer Tools to help see the web page, its elements and the effects of the CSS styling in a clearer and more visual way.

								Then, I finished up the other pages on the website and learnt about using 'external' stylesheets for CSS, which works in a similar to 'internal' stylesheets, but is based on a separate document outside the HTML document.

								Now I started learning about <b>Javascript</b>. Up until now everything had been going ok. I felt like I had got the hang of HTML, and although CSS seemed difficult I felt like it wasn't too complicated. But Javascript definitely felt like a different beast. Now I was actually 'programming' instead of 'coding'. I was making things happen on the website. And the first thing I made happen was an alert message.

								Finally seeing the password feature working was exciting. Now my simple website was brought to life. It could interact with the user, and deny or permit entry. I realised that Javascript, or programmatic code, is very powerful.

								Honestly, by this point I was struggling with the course. The teacher was throwing around all these terms and I couldn't quite make sense of it all. Words like "functions", "methods", "variables", "arrays", "objects" ... it was plain English but I couldn't understand any of it!
								<br><br>
								So I decided to take a pause from the course and go on my own research expedition in order to try and understand all these terms and in doing so, Javascript. It took longer than I expected initially, but I think it really helped my understanding of the language. When I came back to the course, the things that confused me originally now seemed pretty easy.
								<br><br>
								This video shows all the notes that I made during this 'research expedition' period. As you can see at the end, I didn't quite finish everything, but I definitely intend on doing so one day.

								The last part of the course was about the framework "Bootstrap". A framework basically makes coding/programming easier by giving you a load of shortcuts which other (very good) coderse and programmers have made, but you can freely use in order to make your website or application etc quicker and more easily. Here the idea was to make a website based on Harry Potter.
								<br><br>
								After doing so much coding myself learning about Bootstrap and using their class attributes and their pre-made code felt like cheating! But I saw the value in it and the visual result I think speaks for itself. I definitely want to come back and learn more about it in the future.
								<br><br>
								This was the last part of the course! I learnt a lot, and made a lot of notes! Now I decided it was time to put what I'd learnt into practice and make my own website, the result of which you are seeing now!
