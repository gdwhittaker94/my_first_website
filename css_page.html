                <b> CSS </b> means <em>"Cascading Style Sheets"</em> and it was created by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie (co-worker of Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of HTML) and Bert Bos, and was officially released in 1996. Don't worry, "Cascading Style Sheets" also perplexed me when I first heard it. That is why there is a picture of a human focusing mainly on it's skin and muscular system on the left. Like I said <b><a href="./html_page.html" target="_blank">on my page about HTML</a></b>, we can imagine building a web page like the human body.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to make a web page first we need a structure on which to hang and hold everything. For a human that part is the skeleton. In the web development world, that structure is HTML. Second, we need to add to that basic structure in order to flesh it out, to bring it to life, to make it look nice. For a human that part is the skin and muscular system, in the web development world that part is CSS.
            <p>
                CSS is another coding language (like HTML) that allows us to modify and style any <b><i>visible</i></b> element on our web page within our HTML code. We can control the appearance (<u>aka "styling"</u>) of our content including: text size, colour, style, typeface, alignment; link color and style; image size and adjustment; list bullet styles and indentation; table size, shading, borders, alignment and so much more. At first this kind of thing was done in the HTML document, but it made everything messy and complicated, especially when similar styles repeated across multiple HTML documents. Hence why CSS was invented - to allow us to separate design and content and make the web development process easier and simpler.
            </p>
            <p>
                That is, CSS allows us to make our boring HTML based web page look beautiful and interesting to the user. It is all about the visual appearance of a web page. This is so fundamental to web development that it's virtually impossible to use one of these coding languages without the other. Indeed, in my <a href="./html_page.html" target="_blank">previous notes about HTML</a> I made reference to CSS code many times. But CSS has little to do with making the page functional and interactive, for that we will need another programming language later on (Javascript). A website built well with CSS can look like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp#:~:text=CSS%20Demo%20%2D%20One%20HTML%20Page%20%2D%20Multiple%20Styles!" target="_blank">this</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below will be examples and explanations of the different parts of CSS, what the code looks like and what effect it has on a web page or on the HTML content.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>NB:</b> CSS is often cited as being a 'hard' or 'weird' coding language. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHUtMbJw8iA" target="_blank">video</a> does a great job at explaining why this is and some of the guiding principles behind CSS.

                              This is the thing about the HTML tag/element we want to change or modify. There can never be an open space between words; we have to join them with a hyphen <i>like-this!</i>

                          <li>

                      <b>A "declaration" is the name we give to the 'property:value' pair with each declaration separated by a semi-colon (;) symbol</b>.

                      <b>All declarations for a selector are contained within curly brackets '{...}', called a "declaration block"</b>.

So there won't be any conflict of styling rules.

                  <h4> CSS Selectors</h4>
                      <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                          As we said in the above section, a CSS selector is the HTML tag or element we want to target with our CSS styling rules. The selector is like a bridge: 'bridging' the gap between our CSS code and the HTML code. However, we can have different types of selectors and it's very important to understand the differences and be able to use the selectors well as they are so fundamental to using CSS:
                          <br> <br>
                          <b>Quick note: CSS selectors are usually case-sensitive</b>. That is, '.main<u>c</u>ontent' is not the same as '.main<u>C</u>ontent'. It's important to watch this or else you may see unexpected styling results on your web page!
                          <br><br>
                          <ol class="htmlKeyInfo selectorsListNumbers">
                            <li>
                              <b>HTML Element Selectors</b>
                            </li>
                              <p class="cssExplainerInfo">
                                Here we <b>simply write the name of element we want to target</b> (or the <i>keyword</i> inside the < tag > if we want to think about it that way) such as 'h1', 'p', 'div' and then we write our declaration block.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>This selector selects <u>all</u> HTML elements of this type/keyword within our HTML document</b>. In general this is not useful because its effect is so wide-reaching when usually we only want to style one or a few elements at a time.
                              </p>
                            <li>
                              <b>Class Selectors</b>
                            </li>
                              <p class="cssExplainerInfo">
                                In our HTML document, inside the opening tag of each element, we can apply a <b>class="" attribute</b>. The value of this attribute is essentially a name or label which we apply to this element and acts as a bridge between the HTML element and the CSS styling intended for it, allowing the styling rules to 'cross' the bridge and take effect. Remember, HTML and CSS are two separate coding languages and so need to be connected somehow in order for the CSS to work with HTML. For example:
                                <br><br>
                                <span style="color: crimson"><b>HTML:</b> &nbsp;< h1 <u>class="header1"</u>> ...< /h1 ></span>
                                <br><br>
                                Then, in our internal or external CSS stylesheet, we put <b>a dot (.) aka the 'class selector' </b>and the value (name/label) we gave our class attribute in the HTML element, followed by curly brackets '{...}'. So this above theory in practice looks like this:
                                <br><br>
                                  <span style="color: crimson"><b>CSS:</b> &nbsp;<u>.header1</u> {...}</span>
                                <br><br>
                                <b>Inside the curly brackets '{...}' go the CSS styling rules</b> which will be immediately applied to the < h1 > element. For example, <i> color: blue; font-size: larger; </i>etc...

                                      It's possible to create multiple classes (multiple class="" attribute values) within the class attribute. That is, one HTML element can belong to several classes and receive several different CSS styling rule-sets.

                                      For example, a class attribute with the value of "index-h1" or "index_h1" is just one class name (due to the hyphen and underscore lines joining the words together) and would be targeted in CSS like this <i>'.index-h1'</i>. &nbsp;However, "index h1" are two separate class names and could be targeted separately in CSS like this <i>'.index {...}'</i> and <i>'.h1 {...}'</i>. We might do this in order to separate our styling rules, which we might do because (see next section)...

                                      For example, if we have two < h1 > elements on our HTML document, and we give them both a class attribute with the value "index-h1" (<code>< h1 class="index-h1" ></code>), then both these < h1 > elements will receive the exact same styling rules and will look the same on our web page. <br><br>
                                      If we have two < h1 > elements on our document and we want <i>some</i> but not all of the styling rules from the first one to apply to the second one, if we separated the class values ("index h1" not "index-h1") then we can give our second element a class attribute value of "index" and all the '.index' styling rules will be applied, but then create another class attribute value (say "h1_2") with distinct styling rules so our second < h1 > element looks different from the first.

                                      Furthermore, because we can apply distinct class attribute values to distinct HTML elements, we could also apply our ".index" styling rules intended for the Header 1 elements to a totally different element like a < p > element as well.

                                      For example, we have a < div > element (a container element) and inside this container we have a few paragraphs using the < p > tag. The < div > element is the 'parent' element and the < p > elements are the 'child' elements. Instead of adding a class attribute to every single paragraph tag we can just have one class in the < div > tag (<i>e.g. class="indexIntroDiv"</i>). Then, in our CSS stylesheet we write the name of the class as usual, <i>.indexIntroDiv</i>, but then followed by the child element <em>inside</em> the parent element we want to target. So our CSS code will look something like this:<br><br>
                                      <i style="color:rgb(29, 90, 194)">.indexIntroDiv <b>p</b> {...}</i>  ... which is like writing this ... <i style="color:rgb(29, 90, 194)">.indexIntroDiv --> <b>p</b> {...}</i>

                                      And this works because in HTML there is a <em>hierarchical</em> structure. That is, if a parent element is affected or altered in some way, then all its children elements are effected too. For example, in the HTML document the < body > tag is at the top of our visible web page hierarchy. If we add styling to that element then <em>all</em> elements below it will receive that styling too. That is to say, our entire web page!

If we forget this often this can cause confusion when we don't get an expected styling result on our web page.

                                  The <b>id="" attribute</b> attribute can, like the <i>class=""</i>, be applied to <em>any</em> HTML element and works very much in the same way as the <i>class=""</i> attribute. For example, repeating the example from before but using the <i>id=""</i> attribute our example now looks like this:
                                  <br><br>

                                  This time, in our internal or external CSS stylesheet, we put <b>a hashtag symbol (#) aka the 'id selector'</b> and the value (name/label) we gave our id attribute in the HTML element, followed by curly brackets '{...}'.

So in our above example, our CSS styling rules will <em>only</em> be applied to the HTML element with the id="header1", we cannot have a second < h1 > element and also apply the id="header1" to it. Instead, we would have to create a different id value such as id="header2".

                                  To target these custom HTML elements in CSS we write the HTML element/tag we want to target (e.g. 'div'), followed immediately by the class selector (.) and then the value of the <i>class=""</i> attribute which we have applied to certain 'div' elements (but not all 'div' elements).

                                  Now, to target this very specific HTML element all we have to do is add the id selector to the end of our previous CSS selector code. For example:

                                    More general than the child selector, the descendant selector <b>targets any descendants of a particular element, whether direct children or not.</b> A descendant refers to any element that is connected to, or contained by, a higher level element in the document tree - no matter how many levels lower it is. For example, <em>all</em> visible elements on our web page are descendants of the < body > element, like the < h1 >, < ol >, < li >, < p > and < img > elements in the image above.

This avoids us from targeting other < a > elements elsewhere accidentally.

The syntax is like this: <b>A1 + A2</b> where 'A2' is the target of the selector. For example:

                      <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                          When a browser loads a web page, first it reads all the HTML code in order to understand the structure and get the main content for it. Then it reads all the CSS code in order to understand how to style that structure and content and make it appear visually as we intended it to. <b>There are three ways to add CSS code to our HTML document and thus three locations where the browser can look for and find CSS styling for our HTML code:</b>
                          <br><br>
                          <ol class="htmlKeyInfo">

                              <b>Inline Styling</b>
                            </li>
                              <p class="cssExplainerInfo">
                                So called because we style on the same line as, or 'inline' with, our HTML code. We do this by applying the <b class="boldGreenTxt">style="" attribute</b> to the opening HTML tag of an individual element and then writing our CSS declarations ('property: value;') but here <em>without</em> the need for any curly brackets. Instead the declarations go inside the double quotation marks of the <i>style=""</i> attribute, separated from each other by a semi-colon.
                                <br><br>
                                Inline styling only applies to <u>one</u> HTML element at a time. Therefore, it's not very practical for styling whole websites or web pages and, furthermore, it has the disadvantages of not being able to offer all the features that come with our other styling methods (below) like pseudo elements, pseudo classes and media queries and makes our code look messier and harder to read. Because of its <b>high-specificity level</b> it always beats the below styling methods (see "Explaining the CSS name" notes for more information on this logic).
                                <br><br>
                                For example: <code> <br>
                                <span style="color: crimson"> < p <u>style="color:red; text-decoration:underline"</u> > Here will be the individually styled paragraph text < /p > </span></code>
                              </p>
                            <li>
                              <b>Internal Stylesheet</b>
                            </li>
                              <p class="cssExplainerInfo">
                                So called because we write our CSS styling within, and effect at the same time, the HTML document that we are targeting - 'internally'. Outside this unique HTML document the CSS styling rule-sets have no effect. We create this kind of stylesheet by inserting the <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">< &#115;tyle > tag</b> within the HTML < head > tags at the top of our HTML document. We can use as many <i>< &#115;tyle ></i> tags as we want within the < head > section, as long as they remain within that section. We then connect to the elements in our HTML document using CSS selectors like class, id, child, [attribute] etc.
                                <br><br>
                                This way of styling is of a <b>medium-specificity level</b> because the styling rules can apply to the whole HTML document, but only to this one. Therefore, we should only really use this form of CSS styling if we have a single HTML document with a unique style. If we repeat the same styling rules across several documents, it's better to use the last option in the list.
                                <br><br>
                                For example: <code> <br>

                                So called because we write our CSS styling outside of the HTML document which we are targeting. In fact, we write them in a separate '.css' file, which is loaded into the HTMl document through the <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">< link > tag</b> which goes within the HTML < head > tags at the top of our HTML document. Typically this will look like this: <br><br>
                                <code>
                                  <span style="color: crimson">

                                This way of styling is of a <b>lower-specificity level</b> because the styling rules can apply to the whole website. <b>This is the default way to style our HTML document using CSS </b>because it means we can change many things, located in different places in our HTML documents, from one place and without cluttering our original HTML document. Moreover, changes can easily be made and adjusted through the use of CSS selectors like class, id, child, [attribute] etc.

              <h4> Explaining the CSS Name (Specificity)</h4>
                  <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                      CSS stands for "Cascading Stylesheets." But what does that mean?
                  </p>
                  <div class="cssNameDiv">
                    <img src="./images/cascade_img.jpg" alt="Waterfall/Cascade" class="cssSyntaxImg_1">
                  </div>
                  <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                      It might be helpful to think of a <b style="color:#4fa8c5;">'cascade'</b> (or more commonly, a waterfall) when thinking about the meaning of CSS's name, hence the above picture. The question we have to ask ourselves when we start to learn about CSS is:
                      <br><br>
                      <b>When a page includes multiple external, internal, and inline style rule-sets, which rule-set takes precedence? </b>
                      <br><br>
                      The way CSS works is very much like a 'cascade' or waterfall in that it reads rule-sets and instructions <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">from top to bottom.</b> For example, if we have two < link > tags in our < head > section which link to external CSS stylesheets, CSS would use the second one that appears because it is the last rule-set it found before displaying the HTML and so it overrides previous CSS code. The second stylesheet is <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">closer</b> to the HTML it's styling, it's <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">more specific</b>. Another example is if we have to individual rule-sets for an HTML element (e.g. a < h1 > element) within an internal stylesheet. Imagine we write 'h1 {color:green]' but then further down that stylesheet we write 'h1 {color: yellow}'. CSS would use the second rule-set because reading from top to bottom that it the more specific and closer rule-set than the 'h1 {color: green}' one.
                      <br><br>
                      Typically the CSS 'cascading' works like this:
                      <br><br>
                      First, the browser starts with the most distant/less specific stylesheets for the HTML code. The most distant stylesheet in this case is the <b class="boldCascadeTxt">browser stylesheet</b>. In fact, all browsers have their own default styles (a list of which can be seen <b><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_default_values.asp" target="_blank">here</a></b>). So then, without even inputting any CSS code ourselves, our web page will already have default color settings (e.g. a white background with black text), font style, will automatically configure headings and text sizes etc. This is so the browser can initially display a web page and its content to the web developer.
                  </p>
                        <div class="cssCascadingArrow">
                          &#11015;
                        </div>
                  <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                      The next most distant/specific stylesheet is the <b class="boldCascadeTxt">external CSS stylesheet (a separate '.css' file)</b>. These are custom styling rules and for that reason are more specific but, moreover, they are more closely located to the HTML code and for these two reasons the external stylesheet overrides the previous browser's default stylesheet.
                        <div class="cssCascadingArrow">
                          &#11015;
                        </div>
                  </p>
                  <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                      Then, we have the <b class="boldCascadeTxt">internal CSS stylesheet</b> by using the <b class="boldCascadeTxt">< &#115;tyle > tag</b> within the < head > section of the same HTML document itself. Again, these styling rules are more closely located to our HTML code and are again more specific (internal stylesheet rule-sets only apply to the HTML document in question whereas external stylesheets can apply to multiple documents) and thus override the external stylesheet rule-sets.
                        <div class="cssCascadingArrow">
                          &#11015;
                        </div>
                  </p>
                  <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                      Finally, we have the <b class="boldCascadeTxt">inline styling</b> by using the <b class="boldCascadeTxt">style="" attribute</b>. These styling rules are the closest to the HTML elements being targeted (right next to them in fact) and very specifically tailored for them too. So these styling rule-sets, if present, override all the other styling rule-sets we see above.
                  </p>
                  <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                      <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt"> So then, CSS is a 'cascading' system of styling rules, evaluating rule-sets for their specificity and distance from the HTML element being styled. The closest and most specific CSS rule-set for the element it is trying to style 'wins'.</b>
                      <br><br>
                      For example, imagine we have a paragraph < p > element in our HTML document. And we have these styling rules for it:
                      <br><br> <i style="color: crimson">
                      <del>Default Browser Stylesheet: {color:black}</del> <br>
                      External Stylesheet: p {color: green} <br>
                      Internal Stylesheet: p {color: red} <br>
                      Inline style: < p style="color: blue" > </i>
                      <br><br>
                      In this case the inline style is the closest rule-set to the paragraph element it's targeting and 'wins' over, or overrides, the other two styling rule-sets and the text appears blue. If we took away the inline style the text would be red. If none of these custom styling rule-sets were present then the browser would default to its own stylesheet, the furthest away and least specific styling rule-set, making the text black.
                      <br><br><br>
                      However, it can get a little more complicated if we include <b>CSS selectors</b> because these too have an effect of CSS levels of specificity! <b class="ExtraNotesBoldTxt">Here is a list with the general order of specificity for CSS selectors:</b>
                  </p>
                      <ol class="htmlKeyInfo selectorsListNumbers">
                        <li>
                          <b>Inline styles</b>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <b>Id selector</b>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <b>Class, pseudo-class, and attribute selectors</b>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <b>Element and pseudo-element selectors</b>
                        </li>
                      </ol>
                  <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                      So that is, if we have external stylesheet which has a rule-set "h2 {color: pink}" and within the same stylesheet a rule-set which says ".h2Black {color:black}" then this second rule-set will be applied to this one < h2 > element because the class selector makes it a more specific rule-set than the generic element. A helpful article has been written about specificity and understanding which CSS selector will override other selectors <b><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_specificity.asp">here.</a></b> Furthermore, we can use this <b><a href="https://specificity.keegan.st/">CSS specificity calculator</a></b> to list out and compare which of our CSS selectors is more specific.

                    This 'cascading down' of styling rule-sets also gives us the concept of  <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">inheritance: when child elements inherit styling rules from their parent elements</b>. Let's imagine a new example:
                    <br><br>
                    <i style="color: crimson">
                    External Stylesheet: div {color: green} <br>
                    Inline style: < p style="color: blue" > </i>
                    <br><br>
                    Imagine we have a < div > element in our HTML document which contains three paragraph elements, each one containing text. We set a styling rule-set for the div element of {color:green} which changes text color to green. However, the div does not contain the text, the paragraph elements do. What happens? (I've coloured the background of the div element to make it visible):
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="inheritanceDivExample">
                      <p> This is the first paragraph element inside the div. </p>
                      <p> This is the second paragraph element inside the div. </p>
                      <p> This is the third paragraph element inside the div. </p>
                    </div>
                  </p>
                  <p class="htmlExplainerInfo" style="margin-bottom:0px; padding-bottom:0px">
                    All the paragraph element texts also appears green! This is because they inherit the green text color from their parent, the div element.
                    <br><br>
                    Now imagine this same div, but we apply an inline styling rule-set to the second paragraph element of 'style=color:blue' which changes text color to blue. What happens?
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="inheritanceDivExample">
                      <p> This is the first paragraph element inside the div. </p>
                      <p style="color:blue;"> This is the second paragraph element inside the div, with an inline style. </p>
                      <p> This is the third paragraph element inside the div. </p>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    Source code: <code> <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;< div class="inheritanceDivExample" > <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;< p > This is the first paragraph element inside the div. < /p > <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;< p style="color:blue;"> This is the second paragraph element inside the div, with an inline style. < /p ><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;< p > This is the third paragraph element inside the div. < /p > <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;< /div >
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                    The second paragraph element text appears blue! Initially all the text is green because they inherit that color from the div element. However, then the browser sees this closer and more specific CSS styling rule-set which beats the more distant external stylesheet styling rule-set, so the text appears blue. Thinking back to the 'cascading' name and the idea of a waterfall, it's like when a big rock in waterfall juts out and prevents the flow of the water from above carrying on into the space below it. The closer or more specific CSS styling rule-sets 'jut out' and block the flow of the cascading CSS styling rule-sets from up above, and thus the element is not effected by them.
                    <br><br>
                    This 'cascading down' inheritance effect is great for web developers because it allows us to be as specific or generic as we want to be with our styling. We donât have to style every single element individually on the web page, which would be very time-consuming.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="extraNotesBoldTxt"> <b>Note: Not all properties inherit!</b> For example the 'color' property inherits, but the 'border' property doesn't. If we want a certain non-inherited property to become inherited by its children, we can write the value of "inherit" for the property within the child element. For example: <i>p {border: inherit}</i>. A list of the properties which are inherited by child elements can be found <b><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5612302/which-css-properties-are-inherited#:~:text=Here%20is%20the%20list%20of%20all%20inheritable%20properies.%20I%27m%20working%20with%20W3C%27s%20information%2C%20so%20I%27d%20guess%20it%20should%20be%20correct.%20But%20knowing%20web%20browsers%20(IE%20specifically)%2C%20some%20of%20these%20might%20not%20be%20inheritable%20by%20all%20browsers%3A">here</a></b>.</span>

                    There is only one instance when all the above information is not true: <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">the "!important" declaration</b>. This is a very special tool and should be used sparingly. This declaration overrides all other selectors and styling rule-sets. To use it we include the phrase "!important" within the value part of the CSS declaration.
                    <br><br>
                    In this new example, we have another < div > with just one paragraph element. In the external stylesheet we will have a rule-set which says the text color should be green. Then we will have an inline stylesheet which says the text color should be red, and finally an inline styling that says the text color should be orange. Notice how, despite the two closer and more specific rule-sets, the external stylesheet 'wins' because of the '!important' declaration we apply. See the photos below to help you understand what is happening:

                  <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                    This information is only really relevant for the web developer. Sometimes in our code we want to leave ourselves comments which the user won't see, but we will in our CSS code. To do this in CSS we have to write this code: <br><br>
                    <b> &nbsp;&nbsp; &#47;&#42; (comment content) &#42; &#47;</b>
                  </p>
                  <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                    When we do this our comment gets greyed out and the browser completely ignores what's inside these brackets. If we only use the left side of the comment, <i>everything</i> after it becomes greyed out and ignored by the browser. For example: <br><br>
                    <img src="./images/css_short_comment.png" alt="Short CSS comment" class="commentImg">
                    <img src="./images/css_long_comment.png" alt="Long CSS Comment" class="commentImg">
                  </p>
                  <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                    Note: We can quickly and easily 'comment out' certain code (in Visual Studio) by selecting the code we want to be commented out with our mouse and then pressing the <b>Ctrl/Cmd + / </b>&nbsp;keys, or by pressing <b>Ctrl + K + C</b>. To quickly 'uncomment out' this code we can press the <b>Ctrl/Cmd + K + U keys</b>.
                  </p>
                  <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">

                          In CSS there are many different methods for selecting colors ('color values') which we then can apply to our HTML elements. However, adding color to HTML elements with CSS is <em>always</em> the same: the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'color:' property</b> or perhaps the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'background-color:' property</b> to start our declaration, followed by the color we have selected. For example, <i>style="color: blue"</i> or p {color:red}. <b>Below is a list of ways for selecting color values in CSS:</b>

Just by typing in a keyword like "Aqua", "Blue" or "Purple" as our color property value, a color will be produced on our web page. Below is an example of applying one of these standard colors in my HTML code and its effect. <br><br>

                                These colors are made by mixing different quantities of red, green, and blue light sources. In our CSS code we do this by writing our <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'color:' property</b> followed by the value - after a semi-colon - of <b class="propertyBoldTxt"> rgb (0, 0, 0)</b> where each zero represents the colors: red, green, blue (in that order).
                                <br><br>
                                Each color/number can have a value of between 0 and 255, where 0 = least intensity and 255 = most intensity. For example:
                                <ul class="rgbInnerList">
                                  <li>
                                    <b id="redRGB">rgb (255, 0, 0)</b> is completely red because because red is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.
                                  </li>
                                  <li>
                                    <b>rgb (0, 0, 0)</b> is black none of the three main colors have any intensity, producing 'nothing' or black.
                                  </li>
                                  <li>
                                    <b id="whiteRGB">rgb (255, 255, 255)</b> is completely white because all the main colors are set to the maximum intensity, producing white.
                                  </li>
                                </ul>

                                Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all the three light sources. For example: <span id="greyRGB">rgb (120, 120, 120).</span>

                                This method is the same as before only that we've added an <b>alpha channel</b> to the end. That means, the <b> color opacity/transparency</b> level of the color. The alpha channel has a value of between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 = fully transparent and 1.0 fully opaque. The effects of the alpha channel can be seen below.

                                Using RGB and RGBA is quite practical in our code because it's easier to make a color more or less transparent by simply adding the alpha channel value to it. We can't do this with the next method.
                              </p>

                              <p class="cssExplainerInfo">
                                With this method we specify a hexadecimal value in the form of <b>#rrggbb</b>, a six digit code which begins with a hashtag (#) symbol. Here rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff, where 0 = least intensity and ff = most intensity. The hexadecimal values can contain a mix of numbers and letters because it uses 16 characters as its base; the numbers 0 through 9 and the letters A, B, C, D, E and F (which corresponds to the decimal numbers 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 respectively) and then returning to 10 (which corresponds to 16 in decimal numbers). For example:
                                <ul class="rgbInnerList">
                                  <li>
                                    <b id="hexBlue">#0000ff</b> is completely blue because because blue is set to its highest value (ff) and the others are set to 0.
                                  </li>
                                  <li>
                                    <b id="hexMustard">#ffa500</b> is mustard yellow, with a strong mix of red, a touch of green, and no blue.
                                  </li>
                                  <li>
                                    <b id="whiteRGB">#ffffff</b> is completely white because all the main colors are set to the maximum intensity, producing white.
                                  </li>
                                </ul>

                                  Again, shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all the three light sources. For example: <span id="hexGrey">#787878</span>

                                  <li>
                                    <b>Saturation:</b> a % value: 0% is no color (i.e. gray, not visible), and 100% is full color. It represents the color intensity and describes the amount of grey we add to the color.

                                  <li>
                                    <b>Lightness:</b> also a % value: 0% is black, 100% is white. It describes the amount of white or black we add to the color.

                                    <b id="hslGreen">hsl (120, 100%, 50%)</b> is a bright green because green is set to its most intense level, the saturation is also at its most intense level and no extra white or extra black is added so we just see the normal color.
                                  </li>
                                  <li>
                                    <b>hsl (0, 100%, 0%)</b> is black. In this case it doesn't matter the hue or saturation level, because the lightness level is at its lowest value meaning the color is black regardless. The same is true when producing white (hsl(0, 100%, 100%).
                                  </li>
                                  <li>
                                    <b id="hslGrey">hsl(0, 0%, 50%)</b> - shades of gray with HSL are often defined by setting the hue and saturation to 0, and adjusting the lightness from 0% to 100% to get darker/lighter shades.
                                  </li>

                                This method can be quite practical because once we find a color that we like, then we can easily play around with the saturation and lightness qualities of the color but without having to change the color value itself. In RGB we have to change all the values in order to have achieve the same change effects.

                        <br><br>
                        It's quite common to use a change in opacity as an effect like, for example, when we hover over the image using the ':hover' pseudo-class:
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="./images/cascade_img.jpg" alt="Waterfall normal" class="Imagethirty" id="imagehover">

                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        <b>Note:</b> when using opacity on an element not only the background of the element that will have transparency, but all of its child elements become transparent as well! For example:
                        <div id="opacity-div">
                            <p> This text is semi-transparent because of the div transparency!</p>
                            <p>*To avoid this we have to use one of the above color selection methods that have alpha channels. </p>

                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        Another effect we can perform is to place text on top of a transparent box which shows through to an image like this:

                          <li>

                          <br>
                          <li>
                            Create another div (e.g. class="transbox") inside the first div.
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li>
                            Set the inner div to have a background color using rgba/hsla and border, and set the transparency level.
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li>
                            Inside the transparent div we add a < p > element with some text. The text won't have any transparency effect applied to it (because of the rgba/hsla setting only applying transparency to the background-color).
                          </li>

              <div class="htmlRowMainOne">
              <h4> CSS Units</h4>
                  <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                      It is essential to know about and understand CSS Units because they are involved with, or are fundamental to, pretty much everything we do with CSS.
                      <br><br>
                      <b>CSS units allow us to style and size things exactly as we want, often expressed as "length" values; that is, a number followed by a length unit e.g. 10px, 2em, etc. They represent a distance or size value</b> There is no gap between the number and length unit (except if the number is 0, then there is no length unit).
                      <br><br>
                      In CSS we have two kinds of length units, within which we have multiple length unit options. However, only a few length unit options are common and widely used on the web:
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                      <b class="propertyBoldTxt">ABSOLUTE LENGTHS</b>
                      <br><br>
                      <b>These length units are fixed, meaning we can set a precise length which will always display as that size regardless of the device or screen it is being displayed on</b>. That is, a < div > with a length of '1cm' will measure exactly 1cm wide, always, whether on a big screen or a small one.
                      <div class="divLeftMargin">
                        <b class="boldGreenTxt">Pro:</b> <span class="boldGreenTxt"> good for physical media like papers, posters and other printed work as we can reliably know how big or small something will appear when printed.</span>
                        <br><br>
                        <b class="boldRedTxt">Con:</b> <span class="boldRedTxt"> as they don't adapt in size to device or screen differences and always stay the same, they're not so good for making our web pages responsive - something which is key in this day and age. That is, if a user wants or need to change the font size of the browser or computer (for example, they having sight problems), these length units don't scale, so the user has to zoom the whole screen in and cut off half the page.</span>
                      </div>
                      <br>
                    <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                      <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">Pixels (px)</b>
                      <ul>
                        <li> Our screens are made up of pixels or 'dots'. 1px = 1 dot. The pixels our screen has, the higher its resolution.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li> The total amount of pixels on a screen varies from device to device. 1px on a big screen seems a lot smaller than 1px on a small screen. A 200px wide < div > container will appear big on a small screen but small on a big screen. So really, 'pixels' as a unit of length is <u>relative</u>.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Is by far the most common absolute length unit and still widely used by web developers.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <br>
                      Although these absolute length units exist, they are rarely used in the web dev world and have the same advantages and disadvantages as any other absolute length unit.

                          <li>
                            The length is <u>relative to the parent element</u>. That is, if the length property of a < div > container is 10px, then for the < p > element within that container 1em=10px, 2em=2px etc.
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li>
                            Can get complicated when used for objects within objects within objects etc because the font-size, always based off the object previous (i.e., the parent element), can potentially compound in size with each new layer, producing bigger and bigger font.
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li>
                            Is good to use for an object so that it has padding or margin that scales with the size of the element (e.g. buttons). That is, the paddings and margins will always be in proportion.
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                      </p>

                        <br><br>
                            <u>Works in the exact same way as 'em'</u>, just represented in percentages. For example, 50% = 50% of the parent element, or 0.5em.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Combining em and %:</b> The < body > tag is the parent element for all our visible web page. If we set a length property (in px), then on our page <i>1em=body element length</i> (e.g. 20px). So, handy trick used by developers to simplify things is to set the font-size for the body element to 62.5% (62.5% of 16px), which equates to 10px, or 0.625em. Now you can set the font-size for any elements using em units, with an easy-to-remember conversion, by dividing the px value by 10. This way 10px=1em, 12px=1.2em, 14px=1.4em, 16px=1.6em, and so on.

                          <li>
                            The length is <u>relative to the < html > or 'root' element at the top of our DOM tree model</u>. That is, it doesn't matter where our element is within the HTML DOM tree, the length of the element we're editing will <em>always</em> be compared to the < html > element at the top of the document.<b> By default, the normal browser font-size is 16px, so 1rem = 16px.</b>

                          <li>
                            Is a very dependable length unit because the root element length is always the same. We know what we're getting when we write '1rem' or '2rem'.

                            The length is <u>relative to the entire width or height of the browser window size</u>. That is, it doesn't matter where our element is within the HTML DOM tree, the length of the element we're editing will <em>always</em> be compared to the browser window size. 1vw=1% of the viewport's width and 1vh=1% of the viewport's height.

                            Is a good length unit for responsive web page design, because the size is always relative to the device or screen size. That is, if the browser size increases, the length of an element or of our font increases, if the browser size decreases, they decrease.

        <!--* SECTION 8: BACKGROUND IMAGES -->


        <section id="background-images-section">
              <div class="htmlRowMain">
                  <div class="htmlRowMainOne" style="background-image: url(images/whitebackground.jpg);">
                  <h4> Background Images and Relative Properties</h4>
                  <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                    On my <b><a href="./html_page.html#HTMLImagesSection" target="_blank">HTML page</a></b> I talked about how we can add images to our web page using the self-closing < img > tag. However, we can also add background images to elements but in order to do this we need CSS.
                    <br><br>
                    To add a background-image to a specific element we need to use the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">"background-image: url(...)" property</b> within one of our three CSS styling locations, linking to the picture you want to use as our element's background image.
                    <br><br>
                    An entire page can have a background image if it is specified in the <b>body element</b> of the HTML document skeleton. Again, using the <i class="propertyBoldTxt">background-image</i> property.
                    <br><br>
                    To properly adjust our background-image we are going to need the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'background-repeat:'</b>, <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'background-size:'</b> and <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'background-position:'</b> properties (we will also look at the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'background-attachment:' property</b>) which will now be explained in more detail below.
                  </p>
                  <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                    Here you can see I've given this whole note box a background image with some texture. To get this effect I have used the following code and a picture I found on <b><a href="https://www.freepik.com/photos/concrete-texture">freepik.com</a></b>.
                    <br><br>
                    <code>
                    style="background-image: url (images/whitebackground.jpg)"</code>
                    <br><br>
                    In the following paragraph element (with a border) I'm going to set a small image as a background and write some text on top of it.
                    <br>
                    <p style="background-image: url(images/logosmall.png); height: 150px; border: solid black;color:#2c1be8"> <b>
                    <br><br> Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Sapiente quas magnam vel facilis assumenda porro soluta nobis suscipit a dolores labore saepe, cum doloremque doloribus quae neque in quasi cumque.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                    By default an image which is smaller than the element if finds itself in repeats itself to cover the whole element. Similarly, an image which is bigger than the element it finds itself in is cropped. To stop this image repetition we need to use the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'background-repeat:' property</b> with a value of <u  class="propertyBoldTxt">no-repeat.</u> This property has other values such as <u class="propertyBoldTxt">repeat-x</u> (only repeat horizontally), <u class="propertyBoldTxt">repeat-y</u> (only repeat vertically), and <u  class="propertyBoldTxt">repeat</u> (repeat both horizontally and vertically) which allows us to greater control the repetition of images. But for now we just need the 'no-repeat' value. Notice the change in this next paragraph.

                    However, now more than half our element doesn't have a background image! To resolve this we can use the <b  class="propertyBoldTxt">'background-size:' property</b> and set it to <u class="propertyBoldTxt">cover</u> which stretches or crops the background image to cover the entire element. Now notice how the picture covers the element:

                    However, now we can't see more than half the image. To fix this we can return to the <b  class="propertyBoldTxt">'background-size:' property</b> and manually adjust the image's size and how much of the element it covers. Now notice how we can cover the whole element and simultaneously see the whole background image, when I set the background-size value to <u  class="propertyBoldTxt"> 100% 100%</u> (height width). That is, 100% of the element's height and 100% of the element's width:

That is, the horizontal center and the vertical center.

                        The <b>'background-image:' property</b> has another interesting use which allows us to make more visually interesting and dynamic backgrounds for our elements and web pages. With this property we can make <b>color gradients</b>, meaning, color blends. There are three types:
                      </p>

                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                      We make linear or 'line' gradients by writing the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'background-image:' property</b> and then giving it a value of <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'linear-gradient (X, Y)'</span>. In the brackets we specify <b>color-stops</b>, meaning, the colors we want to render smooth transitions among - separated by a comma. We can use any of the color selection methods mentioned before in the <a href="#CSSColors">colors section</a> to give us our color values. For example:
                      </p>
                        <div class="div-background-image-linear-gradient-example">
                          This is a div container with a linear gradient background 'image'. CSS code:

                          <code>{background-image: linear-gradient(red, yellow);}</code>

                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        By default the colors transition smoothly from top to bottom, represented by the value <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'to bottom'</span>. However, <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">we can control the direction of the transition</b> by using keyword values or degrees. We put these keywords or degree values <em>before</em> the color-stop values, within the brackets, also separated by a comma. That is: <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'linear-gradient (<u>keyword/degrees</u>, X, Y)'</span>. Below is a list of these keywords and their degree equivalents (use the degree circle diagrams to help you understand what's happening in practice) although if we want to we can write out custom degree values too:

                          <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt"> We can also control when the colors transition into each other</b>. By default as soon as the color appears it starts transitioning into the next color. Specifically, if we don't specify the location of a color stop, it is placed halfway between the previous color and the next one that follows it.  However, to change this we can <b>apply a percentage value <em>after</em> our color value which tells CSS to apply  color A up until X point, and only <em>after</em> this point does it start transitioning into color B</b>. For example:
                        </p>
                        <div class="div-background-image-linear-gradient-example forty">
                          In this div container the red color runs for 40% of the box before it starts transitioning into the yellow color. Compare this to the very first transition box above where the color starts transitioning immediately. CSS code:
                          <br><br>
                          <code> {background-image: linear-gradient(red <b>40%</b>, yellow);}</code>
                        </div>

                        <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                          If we give both colors a value of 50%, we will have a hard line and no transition because both the red color runs up until 50% of the container and yellow starts from the 50% mark, leaving no room for a transition. For example:
                        </p>
                        <div class="div-background-image-linear-gradient-example fifty-fifty">
                          A div container with two colors at 50%. CSS code:

                          <code>{background-image: linear-gradient(red <b>50%</b>, yellow <b>50%</b>);}</code>
                        </div>

                        <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                          In a similar way, we can name multiple color-stops and give them matching start and end values in order to create a rainbow type effect. For example:
                        </p>
                        <div class="div-background-image-linear-gradient-example rainbow">

                          <code> {background-image: linear-gradient(to right, red 20%, orange 20% 40%, yellow 40% 60%, green 60% 80%, blue 80%);}</code>
                        </div>

                        <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                          We can add the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'repeating-'</b> keyword before our <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'linear-gradient:' </span> property keyword in order to create a repeating color pattern which continues infinitely until the element area is filled. For example:
                        </p>
                        <div class="div-background-image-linear-gradient-example repeating">

                          Lastly we can use color transparency to create a <b>fading effect</b>. To do this we simply need to use a color selection method that allows an 'alpha' channel such as rgba or hsla, and choose our color-stops like normal. For example:
                        </p>

              <h4> Other Background Properties</h4>
                <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                  We're not just restricted to using <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'background-image:' property</span> in order to give life to our backgrounds. We can also set our background as a <b>color.</b>
                  <br><br>
                  <b>Note: The 'background' of an element is the total size of the element, including padding and border (but <u> not the margin</u>).</b>
                </p>
                <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                  We can use the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'background-color:' property</b> to <b>establish a color as our element's background</b>. The value of our property can be from one of the following options: standard keyword colors; RGB; RGBA; HEX; HSL; HSLA (see the 'Colors' section from before). For example:
                  <div id="div-background-color-example">
                    This is a div container with a background color. CSS code:
                    <br><br>
                    <code> {background-color: rgb(255, 188, 199);}</code>
                  </div>
                </p>
                <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                  Indeed, <b>we can make the whole web page have a background color</b>. If you look to the left and right of this box about other background properties you will notice the web page has a light blue background color, which I did <b>by applying this CSS rule-set to the < body > tag</b> of my HTML page.
                  <br><br>
                  <code> body {background-color: rgb(242 251 255);} </code>
                  <br><br>
                  As well as a color value, we can choose the <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'transparent'</span> value which specifies that the background color should be transparent - this the element's value by default. In addition, we can choose the <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'inherit'</span> value so that the element inherits the background-color of its parent.
                </p>
                <hr style="text-align:left">
                <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                  We use the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'background-origin:' property</b> <b>to decide where our background-image begins from.</b>
                </p>
                <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                  Before I explain this further, first we must briefly see and understand the <b>CSS Box Model</b> because the terms we are going to use come from this model. In CSS all HTML elements are considered boxes. Boxes which are compromised of several sections. We can see these sections in the picture below:
                  <br><br>
                  <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/764/1*LYIt459KOTM4R-uQFHg_bw.png" alt="CSS Box Model" class="regularImg">
                </p>
                <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                  <i>Remember, we insert our background image by applying the CSS <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'background-image: url(...)' property</b> to the element itself, not inserting it as an element <i>within</i> the element. Then we should give the element some padding, and finally we can start playing around with the where the background-image begins from.</i>
                  <br><br>
                  By default the background-image has the value <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'padding-box'</span> meaning the <b>background image starts from the upper left corner of the padding edge</b>. Here I have colored the inside of the box so the sections can be more clearly seen where the yellow represents the 'content' box, and the pink represents the 'padding' box. Notice how the image starts at the top left of this pink area (but it doesn't go into the area of the border). For example:
                </p>
                  <div class="bg-origin_paddingbox">
                  </div>
                <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                  The value <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'border-box'</span> means the <b>background image starts from the upper left corner of the border area</b>, that is, under the border. For some reason this won't work on my computer but you can see the effect using <b><a href="https://cssreference.io/backgrounds/#background-origin:~:text=The%20background%20image%20starts%20under%20the%20border." target="_blank">this link.</a></b>
                </p>
                <div class="bg-origin_borderbox ">
                </div>
                <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                  The last value <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'content-box'</span> means the <b>background image starts from the upper left corner of the content area</b> in the central part of our 'box'.
                </p>
                <div class="bg-origin_contentbox ">
                </div>
                <br><br>
                <hr style="text-align:left">
                <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                  We use the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'background-clip:' property</b> <b>to decide how far the background (color or image) should extend within an element</b>. <b>Note:</b> this is <em>not</em> the same as the above <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'background-origin:' property</span> which states where the background-image should start from.
                </p>
                <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                  By default the background-image has the value <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'border-box'</span> meaning the <b>background image extends completely throughout the element, even under the border</b>. For example:
                </p>
                <div class="bg-clip-borderbox">
                  Border-box value.
                </div>
                <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                The value <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'padding-box'</span> means the <b>background image extends to the inside edge of the border</b>. For example:
                </p>
                <div class="bg-clip-paddingbox">
                  Padding-box value.
                </div>
                <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                  The value <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'content-box'</span> means the <b>background image extends to the edge of the content box</b>. For example:
                </p>
                <div class="bg-clip-contentbox">
                  Content-box value.
                </div>
                <br><br>
                <hr style="text-align:left">
                <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                  We use the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'background-blend-mode:' property</b> to decide the blending mode of each background layer (color and/or image). That is, how two or more images 'blend' into each other, they mix. For example:
                </p>
                <div class="bg-blendmode">
                </div>
                <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                  Here I have set the value to  <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'difference'</span> to make the effect very obvious, but by default the blending mode is set to <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'normal'</span>. All the different values for this property, and their effects, can be clearly and quickly seen <b><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playdemo.asp?filename=playcss_background-blend-mode">here.</a></b>

                      <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                        With CSS we can change how our text appears in many ways. <br><br>
                        <b> Below is a list of the different CSS properties we can apply to our text which <em>don't</em> start with the word 'text', plus examples to show their effects.</b>
                      </p>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                          The <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'color:' property</b> <b>changes the color of our text</b>. The value of our property can be from one of the following options: standard keyword colors; RGB; RGBA; HEX; HSL; HSLA (see the 'Colors' section from before).
                          <div class="divLeftMargin">
                            <span class="textproperty-color">This is an example of this property. </span>

                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        The <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'background-color:' property</b> <b>changes the background-color of our text</b>. Again, our value for this property can come from the range of options mentioned above.
                        <div class="divLeftMargin">
                          <span class="textproperty-bgcolor">This is an example of this property. </span>
                        </div>
                      </p>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        The <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'direction:' property</b> and <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'unicode-bidi:' property</b>
                       allow us to <b>make text go in a right to left direction</b>, instead of the standard left to right direction. To do this we apply to the first property the value <span class="propertyBoldTxt">rtl</span> and to the second <span class="propertyBoldTxt">bidi-override</span>. For example:
                       <div class="divLeftMargin">
                        <span class="textproperty-direction">This is an example of this property.</span>

                      </p>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        The <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'letter-spacing:' property</b> <b>allows us to choose the space between the characters of our text</b>. We give our value as a unit of measurement (e.g. 10px), which in this instance can be negative also. For example:
                        <div class="divLeftMargin">
                          <p class="textproperty-letterspacing"> This paragraph has a letter-spacing property value of 5px. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>

                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        The <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'word-spacing:' property</b> <b>allows us to choose the space between the words of our text</b>. We give our value as a unit of measurement (e.g. 10px, 20%), which in this instance can be negative also (except percentages). <b>Note:</b> Word spacing can be affected by text justification, also, even though whitespace is preserved, spaces between words are affected by the word-spacing property. For example:
                        <div class="divLeftMargin">
                          <p class="textproperty-wordspacing1"> This paragraph has a word-spacing property value of 10px. Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Harum, illo voluptas eum eligendi asperiores debitis est.</p>

                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        The <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'line-height:' property</b> <b>allows us to choose the space between the lines of our text</b>. We give our value as a unit of measurement (e.g. 10px, 20%) or simply as a number (e.g. 1) which uses the current font-size as the point of reference for the measurement. <b>Note:</b> If the value of the line-height property is greater than the value of the font-size for an element, this difference is cut in half and distributed evenly at the top and bottom of our text. For example:
                        <div class="divLeftMargin">
                          <p class="textproperty-lineheight1"> This paragraph has a line-height property value of 80%. Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Harum, illo voluptas eum eligendi asperiores debitis est.</p>

                          <b>A font is a set of printable or displayable text characters in a specific style.</b> Choosing the right font and style is very crucial for the readability of text on a page, it can make a big impact on how readers experience a website, and it can create a strong identity for a brand. In short, the font we pick for our website is very important!
                          <br><br>
                          First, before we look at the different CSS properties for changing a text's font, let's try to understand more about fonts in general:
                      </p>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                          There are five generic font families, which short explanations about font psychology to go with them, examples of which can be see <b><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font.asp#:~:text=than%20serif%20fonts.-,Some%20Font%20Examples,-Generic%20Font%20Family" target="_blank">here</a></b>.

                              <li><b class="propertyBoldTxt">Serif: </b>fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality, elegance, heritage, and authority.</li>
                              <br>
                              <li><b class="propertyBoldTxt">Sans-Serif: </b>fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern, minimalistic, straightforward and sophisdicated look.</li>
                              <br>
                              <li><b class="propertyBoldTxt">Monospace: </b>here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look and is most commonly used to display code.</li>
                              <br>
                              <li><b class="propertyBoldTxt">Cursive: </b>imitate human handwriting. They feel more personal but rely on context to get their point across. They can create a formal, elegant feel or equally a more fun, playful feel - depending on the cursive font.</li>
                              <br>
                              <li><b class="propertyBoldTxt">Fantasy: </b>decorative/playful fonts, but not widely available across different browsers and operating systems.</li>
                              <br>

                        What do we mean when we talk about 'small strokes' at the edges of the letter? Here's a picture to demonstrate the differences:

                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">Note: Not all fonts work on all browsers or on all devices!</b> If a browser or device doesn't support the font we choose for our website, then that browser or device will fall back onto its default font style - meaning the user won't have the website experience we intended!
                        <br><br>
                        To get around this we have something called <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt"> "web-safe fonts"</b>. That is, fonts that are universally installed across all browsers and devices. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font_websafe.asp#:~:text=Try%20it%20Yourself%20%C2%BB-,Best%20Web%20Safe%20Fonts%20for%20HTML%20and%20CSS,-The%20following%20list" target="_blank">These are fonts</a> that are very highly likely to be available to the user's browser or device, however, <u>no font is 100% 'web-safe'!</u>.
                        <br><br>
                        Another method to get around this is to link the browser to a font file (using the < link > tag in the < head > section of our HTML document), making the font available for every userâs web browser <em>before</em> they use our document. This gives web developers a lot more options than the web safe options!
                        <br><br>
                        The issue of web-safe fonts brings us nicely onto the first important CSS property for fonts.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p class="htmlKeyInfo">

                    </p>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        We use the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'font-family:' property</b> <b>to select the font of a text</b>. We write the name of the font we want as the value for the property. Fonts which contain multiple words must be wrapped in quotation marks ("...").
                        <br><br>
                        In fact <b>we can write several font name values - separated by commas</b>. This allows us to create a <b>'fallback system'</b> whereby if one font is not recognised or not available to the browser, then it will try the next one, then the next one etc. <b>The last font for this property should always be a generic font family</b>. That way, the browser will pick a font that is has available to it which at least looks similar to the original font we wanted to use. For example:
                        <div class="divLeftMargin">
                          <code style="margin-left:3vw">{font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif}</code>
                        </div>

                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        The <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'font-style:' property</b> <b>makes our text italic</b>.There are two values we can use: <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'normal'</span> meaning 'not italic' and <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'italic'</span> meaning our text will be italicised.
                        <div class="divLeftMargin">
                          <span class="font-style-example">This is an example of text with the 'font-style' property applied to it. </span>

                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        The <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'font-weight:' property</b> <b>specifies the 'weight' or boldness of our text</b>, how thick or thin the characters are displayed. There are a couple values we can choose from, either choosing from keywords or numerical values:
                        <div class="divLeftMargin" class="verticalAlignList">

                            <li><b class="propertyBoldTxt">bold: </b>defines thick characters. <span class="font-weight-bold">For example.</span></li>

                            <li><b class="propertyBoldTxt">bolder/lighter: </b>defines thicker and thinner characters. The browser uses the next available weight.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b class="propertyBoldTxt">Numerical values (100-900): </b>Defines characters from thin to thick where the numbers represent the following named weights (if the font-family can't provide the requested weight it will provide the next closest one):

                              <ul>

                                <li>400 = normal </li>
                                <li>500 = medium</li>

                        The <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'font-variant:' property</b> <b>specifies whether or not a text should be displayed in a small-caps (small capital letters) font.</b>.That is, uppercase letters but smaller than the original font. We give this property the value <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'small-caps'</span>.
                        <div class="divLeftMargin">
                          <span class="font-variant-example">This is an example of text with the 'font-variant' property applied to it. Notice the letters are all in uppercase, but the text still appears small. </span>

                        The <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'font-variant-caps:' property</b> is a variant of the 'font-variant:' property which gives us even greater control over the appearance of the small-caps text.

                        The <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'font-size:' property</b> <b>sets the size of our text on the web page</b>. Understanding text size is important in web design. However, we should make sure to use the proper tags and elements instead of abusing CSS to get the appearance we want. That is, we should not use font size adjustments to make paragraphs look like headings, or headings look like paragraphs etc but instead use the < h1 > tag or < p >.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>By default, the normal browser font-size is 16px (16px=1em).</b> However, in order to alter this we have <b>three different methods of sizing our text</b>, each with different advantages and disadvantages.
                      </p>

                            <p class="central-text"><b>ABSOLUTE FONT-SIZE</b></p>
                            <p>
                              This allows us to <b>precisely set a font-size that will not change regardless of the device or browser being used</b>. The user cannot change the font-size within their browser - which <b>is bad for accessibility reasons</b>. Is useful when the physical size of the output is known (e.g. printing). Below is a selection of the different measurement values we can use to produce absolute font-sizes:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="ul-arrows">
                              <li>
                                <b>Pixels (px):</b> this is a good choice when you need the pixel accuracy. However, it's not very accessible because users with limited or low vision may wish to enlarge the font-size and they won't be able to. It is possible to user the 'zoom' feature, but this resizes the entire page and so the user can't see the rest of the page when they zoom in. Therefore, it's best to avoid pixel values.
                              </li>
                              <br>
                              <li>
                                <b>Absolute Keywords:</b> here we just use certain keywords in order to size the text whose value is <u>relative to the < html > root element</u>. We saw before that the default browser text size is 16px, which is the equivalent here to 'medium'. These words are: <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'xx-small' (9px), 'x-small' (10px), 'small' (13px), 'medium' (16px), 'large'(18px), 'x-large'(24px), 'xx-large'(32px)</span>. Using this method, by setting a font size on the < body > element, we can set the relative font sizing everywhere else on the page, giving us the ability to easily scale the font size up or down accordingly.
                              </li>
                            </ul>

                              <p class="darkcyan">
                                This allows us to set a font-size that <u>is relative to the size of the browser window.</u> That is, if the browser size increases, the font-size increases, if the browser size decreases, the font-size decreases. We have two measurement values we can use to produce responsive font-size:
                              </p>
                              <ul class="ul-arrows darkcyan">
                                <li>
                                  <b> Viewport width (vw):</b> here 'viewport' means the browser window. 1vw=1% of the viewport's width.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                  <b> Viewport height (vh):</b> again 'viewport' means the browser window. 1vh=1% of the viewport's height.
                                </li>
                              </ul>
                              <p class="darkcyan">
                                However, the problem with the responsive font-size method is that on small screens fonts become so small that they are hardly readable! To prevent this we can utilize CSS calc() function (see <b><a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/css-responsive-fluid-typography-a23a9aab19a#:~:text=Limit%20scaling%20using%20calc()">here</a></b>) or we can use media queries.
                              </p>
                            </ul>

                              This <b>allows us to set the font-size <em>relative</em> to the surrounding elements and is good for accessibility reasons </b>because this method <em>does</em> allow a user to change the font-size within their browser. Below is a selection of the different measurement values we can use to produce absolute font-sizes:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="ul-arrows">
                              <li>
                                <b>Em:</b> this unit of measurement <u>refers to the font-size of the parent element</u> where 1em is the same as the font of size of the parent element. Using the default browser font-size, 1em=16px, 2em=32px etc. To get our em value we simply have to divide pixels by 16 (px/16=em).
                                <br><br>
                                <b>Note:</b> The < body > tag is the parent element for all our visible web page. If we set a font-size here (in px), then on our page <i>1em=body element font-size</i> (e.g. 20px). Also, within each new child element if we put the font-size as 1.2em the text will gradually balloon in size as each element's font-size grows on the last. Lastly. we can use 'em' for the sizes of margins and paddings which meaning their size will be relative to the element's font-size. This means regardless of whether the user is on a big or small screen, the sizes of the paddings/margins etc will be in proportion
                              </li>
                              <br>

                                <b>Percentages:</b> percentages act in the same way as 'em' values because the font-size also <u>is relative to the parent's font-size</u>. So 110%=1.1em, 90%=0.9em etc.

                                <b>Combining percentages and em:</b> a handy trick used by developers to simplify things is to set the font-size for the body element to 62.5% (62.5% of 16px), which equates to 10px, or 0.625em. Now you can set the font-size for any elements using em units, with an easy-to-remember conversion, by dividing the px value by 10. This way 10px=1em, 12px=1.2em, 14px=1.4em, 16px=1.6em, and so on.
                              </li>
                              <br>
                              <li>
                                <b>Rem:</b> or 'Root em' is different from 'em' because the element's font-size is always <u>relative to the  < html > root element</u> regardless of where the element is within the DOM tree model. That is, the value remains context independent. Typically, the root element font-size is 16px so 1rem = 16px.
                              </li>
                              <br>

                                <b>Relative Keywords:</b> here we just use the keywords <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'smaller'</span> or <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'larger'</span> to specify a larger or smaller size <u>relative to the parent element</u>. If the parent element's font size is 20px, then setting the child's font-size to 'bigger' will mean its font-size is slightly more than 20px, and setting it to 'smaller' will mean its font-size is slightly less than 20px.
                              </li>
                            </ul>

                        The <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'font:' property</b> <b>is a shorthand version that allows us to set all the individual font properties in one property</b>. In this shorthand version, the <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'font-size'</span> and <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'font-family'</span> values are required. If one of the other values is missing, their default value is used. The order of the values for this property go as follows (without the dashes): <span class="propertyBoldTxt">font-style - font-variant - font-weight - font-size/line-height - font-family</span>.

                              It's possible to <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">request multiple Google fonts at the same time</b>, in the same link, by using the pipe (|) symbol (althought this may slow down web page loading times). For example:
                              <br><br>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?<u>family=Tangerine|Inconsolata|Droid+Sans</u></i>
                              <br><br><br>
                              By default, the Google Fonts API provides the regular version of the requested fonts. To <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">request other styles or weights</b>, append a colon (:) to the name of the font, followed by a list of styles or weights separated by commas (,). Make sure to check the individual fonts to see what styles and weights are available. For example:
                              <br><br>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?<u>family=Tangerine:bold,bolditalic|Inconsolata:italic|Droid+Sans</u></i>
                              <br><br><br>
                              For each style we request, we can <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">give either the full name or an abbreviation</b>; for weights, you can alternatively specify a numerical weight. For example:
                              <br><br>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;italic or i <br>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bold, b, or a numerical weight such as 700 <br>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bolditalic, or bi
                              <br><br><br>
                              If we want a font just for one word or piece of text (e.g. a brand logo, or one sentence on our webpage) we can <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt"> just request the letters required</b> from Google, reducing our file size tremendously. To do this, simply add <b>'&text='</b> to your Google Fonts API requests. For example:
                              <br><br>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Inconsolata<u>&text=Hello</u></i>

                            <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                              <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">It's possible to add effects to our Google Font text</b>. Google has provided a collection of font effects that we can use with minimal effort to produce cool display text. To do this, first simply add <b>'&effect='</b> to your Google Fonts API request and add the corresponding class name to the HTML element(s) that you want to affect. For example:
                              <br><br>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Rancho<u>&effect=shadow-multiple</u></i>
                              <br><br>
                              Then, on the HTML element you wish to target, add a special class name which has a value of 'font-effect-' and then the effect name. For example, the class name for 'shadow-multiple' would be 'font-effect-shadow-multiple':
                              <br><br>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp; <i> < div <u>class="font-effect-shadow-multiple"</u> >This is a font effect!< /div ></i>
                              <br><br>
                              You can request multiple effects by separating the effect names with a pipe character (|). For example:
                              <br><br>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp; <i> https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Rancho&effect=<u>shadow-multiple|3d-float</u></i>

                            <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                              Here are some general rules in order to achieve great font pairings for our websites:
                              <ul class="ul-arrows">
                                <li>
                                  <b>Complementary fonts:</b> we can use font pairings that complement one another, they harmonize. They're not too similar, but not too different (which would cause conflict). We want to choose fonts that the user will barely notice a difference between. For example, combining serif with sans serif is a well known combination.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                  <b>Keep it in the family:</b> some fonts have 'superfamilies' meaning they come with a selection of different weights, styles and classifications specially designed to work together. It's hard for any combination of a superfamily to go wrong. For example: Lucida Sans, Lucida Serif, Lucida Typewriter Sans, Lucida Typewriter Serif and Lucida Math.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                  <b>Opposites attract:</b> sometimes a bold contrast in fonts can work well, as long as the contrast brings out the best in each font. We don't want fonts that conflict with each other (for being too different). For example, a bold, rounded typeface combined with a lighter, condensed style will make for happy font pairing.
                                </li>
                                <br>

                                  <b>Only one boss:</b> choose one predominant or 'boss' font. That is, the main, attention grabbing or header font that the user will first see. Make this the consistent boss throughout the website. The other font(s) provide the detail.

                          A small but important topic to include in our CSS notes is that of icons. <b>Icons are graphic symbols that convey their meaning through their pictorial resemblance to a physical object</b>. They help the user understand content, layout and what is happening on a web page in a much quicker way than they would with text. That's why, these days, icons are <em>everywhere</em> and so to include them in our web page design will really help to enhance the look, feel and usuability of it for the user! What's more, we can often customise our icons to our website.
                          <br><br>
                          Below will be linked different places to find and obtain icons for our websites. I will also try to link the explanatory documentation which tells us how to use these pages so the icons appear correctly on our web page:

                            <b><a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Fontawesome.com</a>:</b> probably the most well-known or popular service on the web for getting icons. They have plenty of <b><a href="https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/setup/get-started">documentation</a></b> explaining how to use their icons on our website. Essentially we create a folder or 'kit' on their website, fill it with the icons you want to use, copy and paste the < link > for our folder into the < head > section of our HTML document and then use the < i > tags with their set classes to insert the icons. For example:
                            <br><br>
                            <code>< &#115;cript src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/yourcode.js" crossorigin="anonymous">< /&#115;cript> </code>

                  <h4> The Box Model</h4>
                        <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                          The CSS term 'Box Model' is used when talking about design and layout. <b>According to CSS, <u>all</u> HTML elements are essentially boxes with multiple layers wrapping around it</b>. This box consists of the content area (the content of the HTML element), and then optional margins, borders, and padding areas.
                          <br><br>
                          As this box model applies to all HTML elements, and CSS affects all HTML elements, it's fundamental to understand this model. It helps us structure and layout our web page, as well as understand the relationship between our different HTML elements. When used well, the box model can give our web page structure and make it more visually appealing to the user due to the use of spacing.
                          <br><br>
                          The following diagram demonstrates how the width, height, padding, border, and margin CSS properties determines how much space an element can take on a web page.

                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                          Here's an explanation of the different parts:
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">Content:</b> where content of the HTML element, i.e., where text, images and other content appear - <u>stylable</u>.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                              <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">Padding:</b> a transparent layer that clears an area around the content - <u>not stylable</u>.
                              <p style="margin-left: 1em;  font-style: italic;">
                                <b>Note:</b> if the content area has a background-color then it will be visible through the padding area also.
                              </p>
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                              <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">Border:</b> a border which goes around the padding and content sections - <u>stylable</u>.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                              <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">Margin:</b> a transparent layer that clears an area around the border section - <u>not stylable</u>.
                              <p style="margin-left: 1em; font-style: italic;">
                                <b>Note 1:</b> if the parent element has a background-color then it will be visible through the margin area of the child element.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>Note 2:</b> the margin only protects its own element. That is, if a margin finds another element's margin, the two margin's simply overlap, they don't press up against each other, they don't add their combined lengths. So then, if we have two neighbouring < div > containers and one has a margin of 50px and the other has a margin of 30px, the margin between the two is not 80px! The margin between them will be 50px because the bigger margin is defining the distance between the two containers, it's protecting its own element.
                              </p>
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                        <u><b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">The Height and Width of a CSS Box</b></u>
                        <br><br>
                        Something that is a little confusing is how to calculate the <u>total area (width x height)</u> of the box. Imagine we have a < div > container and we make it measure 100px width by 100px height using the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'height:'</b> and <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'width:' properties*</b>, for example:
                      </p>
                        <div class="box-model-HandW"></div>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo"> <i>
                        <span class="propertyBoldTxt"> *Quick side note:</span> when setting a numerical length value for these properties, if the content does not fit within the specified area, it will overflow - which can be controlled using the <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'overflow:' property</span>. However, the default value is <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'auto'</span> meaning the width and height automatically adjust to allow the content to be displayed correctly. In general, we should avoid setting a fixed width and height unless it is necessary.</i>
                      </p>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        Currently the box has a total area of 100x100px which we can see in the image below. This makes sense because we set our height and width to be this.
                      </p>
                        <br>
                        <img src="./images/div-boxmodel-HandW.png" alt="Div 100x100" class="Imagefifty">
                        <br>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        However, watch what happens when we start adding additional padding (20px), border (5px) and margin (10px) lengths:
                      </p>
                        <br>
                        <div class="box-model-HandW-2"></div>
                        <br>
                        <div class="divTwoInfoColumns">
                          <div>
                            <img src="./images/div-boxmodel-HandW-2.png" alt="Div 150x150" class="Imagefifty HandW2">
                          </div>
                          <div>
                            <img src="./images/div-boxmodel-HandW-2-visual.png" alt="Div Visualised" class="Imagefifty HandW2">
                          </div>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        We can see that now the box's total area (width x height) is 150px! That is because <b>the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'height:'</b> and <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'width:' properties</b> only apply to the <u>content area</u> of our CSS box.</b> Additional box sections get added on top of this.
                        <br><br>
                        So if we want <u>to calculate the total width</u> of a box, we have to perform this calculation: <i> width + padding-left + padding-right + border-left + border-right + margin-left + margin-right = total width.</i>
                        <br><br>
                        And if we want <u>to calculate the total height</u> of a box, we have to perform this calculation: <i> height + padding-top + padding-bottom + border-top + border-bottom + margin-top + margin-bottom = total height.</i>
                        <br><br>
                        But we only wanted a box of 100x100px! This means we would have to tediously cut down on each section and do constant calculations until we get a box which perfectly fits the 100x100px proportions. That would be time-consuming!
                        <br><br>
                        So in order to get round this we can use the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'box-sizing:' property</b> which takes two values:
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            <b class="propertyBoldTxt">content-box:</b> the 'width:' and 'height:' properties <em>only</em> apply to the inner content box of the element's box model. Additional padding, border and margin lengths get added on top of that in order to give us the total box height or width.
                          </li>

                      Putting this property into action, now notice what happens to the div container with the 'box-sizing: border-box' rule-set declaration applied - the box now has a total area of 100x100px and to accommodate this the content area has been reduced in size, allowing the padding, border and margin sections to squeeze in.

                      <b>Tip: to make our lives easier, when starting a project, we can use the universal selector (*) in our CSS stylesheet and apply the rule-set: 'box-sizing: border-box' so that automatically our boxes work this way.</b> This way we should never get confused about what is happening on our web page such as when we set a box to '100%' width, then add padding or margin and find the box is wider than our web page!

                        Two other properties that we might want to use when editing the total size or area of our box are the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'max-height:'</b> and <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'max-width:' properties</b>.
                        <br><br>
                        These properties <b>define the widest and highest possible length values for an element</b>. If the content is larger than the max-width, the content will automatically change the height of the element to adjust. If the content is larger than the max-height, it will overflow (requiring the 'overflow:' property to control this). If the content is smaller than the max-width or height, then these properties have no effect. <b>Note:</b> in both cases the 'max-' property overrides the normal property, meaning, if the width is 300px and the max-width is set to 200px, then the element's actual width will be 200px.
                      </p>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        In a similar way, we can apply to our elements the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'min-height:'</b> and <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'min-width:' properties</b> which establish a min-height or width size for the content box. This value takes precedence over the normal values. That is, if the width is 300px and the min-width is 400px, then the element will be 400px wide not 300px.
                        <br><br>
                        Often, these min and max height and width values are used together in order to create a width and height range, aiding flexible design.

                        Above we just talked about 'padding' or 'margin' without specifying which side of the box we were talking about. Thus, we meant all four sides of the box. However, it's possible to edit just one side of the box, or edit all four sides individually thanks to certain properties for each box section:

                                          The values 'inset', 'outset', 'groove', and 'ridge' create a 3D like effect which essentially depends on the border-color value. This is typically achieved by creating a "shadow" from two colors that are slightly lighter and darker than the border color.

                                          We also have 'none' and 'hidden', which don't display a border. The difference is when we set table cells and borders to collapse the 'none' value has the lowest priority, whereas the 'hidden' value has the highest priority, if any other conflicting border is set.

However, with pixels (px) CSS we <em>never</em> get an oval shape! That's because CSS tries to make half-circles on either side of our content, it doesn't try to make a full circle out of the shape itself.

                                          the shorthand property that allows us to define all the margin widths simultaneously. It can take four values, allowing us to change the width of each individual margin side going in a clockwise direction, e.g. margin: 25px 50px 75px 100px.
                                        </li>
                                      </ul>

                                  </ul>
                            <br>
                            <b style="margin-left:-5vw" id="outline-section-id"> 4. Outline</b>

                                  <ul>
                                      <li>
                                        This is a line drawn around elements, outside the element's border, in order to make them stand out.
                                      </li>
                                    <br>
                                      <li>
                                        The difference with outline from the regular border is that: the outline doesn't impact the box model (the element's total width/height) or the space taken up on the page, it sits on top of everything. meaning that sometimes it may overlap other content.
                                      </li>
                                    <br>
                                      <li>
                                        the outline works very much in the same was as the border and having similar properties. For example we can set the <b><span class="propertyBoldTxt"> 'outline-style:', 'outline-color:', 'outline-width:' properties </span></b> and use a <b><span class="propertyBoldTxt">'outline:' shorthand</span></b>.
                                      </li>
                                    <br>
                                      <li>
                                        the main difference is the <b><span class="propertyBoldTxt">'outline-offset:'</span></b> property which adds space between the outline and the edge or border of an element.

                          <b>This property is essential for controlling the layout of our web page</b>.

                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                          The <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'display:' property</b> defines if and how an element is displayed on our web page. Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is either <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'block'</span> or <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'inline'</span>. Below is a comprehensive list of the key features of these two display values:
                          <br><br>
                          <u><b style="color:rgb(29, 90, 194)">'display: block' element:</b></u>

                            <li>by default put a line space/break between the element before and after it (giving them a visual separation from other elements).</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>doesn't tolerate any other HTML elements being next to it (i.e. side-by-side)</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>by default it takes up the full width available to it on the page and its height is always the size of the content, but, the height and width can be changed as we want.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>can contain other inline or block level elements.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>the < p > (paragraph) and < div > tags are two common 'block' level elements. A full list of the HTML block-level tags/elements can be found <b><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp#:~:text=Here%20are%20the%20block%2Dlevel%20elements%20in%20HTML%3A" target="_blank">here.</a></b></li>

                        Here's a visual example of block level elements just using the < p > tag:
                        <p class="blockLevelExample">
                          This is the first block-level element.
                        </p>
                        <p class="blockLevelExample">
                          This is the second block-level element.
                        </p>
                        <p class="blockLevelExample">
                          Notice how each element appears on separate lines without the need for explicit line breaks (< br >) before and after them and how they fill the entire horizontal width of the area given to them.
                        </p>

                          <li>by default appears on the same line as it's created on, taking up as much room as needed but nothing more. If there is no more room on the line it's created on, it simply wraps onto the next one. </li>
                          <br>
                          <li>typically it only contains text or other inline-level elements, but definitely cannot contain other block-level elements! </li>

                          <li>most text-editing based tags are 'inline' (e.g. < i >, < b>, < mark >) but a full list of the HTML 'inline' level tags/elements can be found <b><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp#:~:text=Here%20are%20the%20inline%20elements%20in%20HTML%3A" target="_blank">here.</a></b></li>

                        Here's a visual example of inline-level elements:</p>
                        <p class="htmlExplainerInfo" style="color:brown;padding-top: 0px; margin-top:0px;">
                        This is a <b>piece</b> of text containing <i>several</i> inline-level <small>elements.</small> <span style="background-color: rgb(250, 250, 139);">Notice how each element changes the text </span> but no line spacing is <sup>inserted</sup> before or after each change, no block is created, instead<q>each change simply carries on one after another.</q>
                      </p>

                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo" style="padding-top: 0px; margin-top:0px;">
                        <u><b style="color:rgb(29, 90, 194)">Overriding default display values:</b></u>
                        <br><br>
                          We can change how an element is displayed on a web page via the 'display:' property</b>. This can be useful for making the page look a specific way, and still follow the web standards. It's common to make the < li > elements have an 'inline' display in order to make horizontal menus.
                          <br><br>
                          To demonstrate the effect of changing an element's display property, in the following example three <b style="color:rgb(29, 90, 194)">< span ></b> elements have been given the display property value of <i>'block'</i> meaning they now appear on different lines (with no < br > tags in between them), essentially turning them in < p > elements like we saw in the first example:
                      </p>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo" style="padding-top: 0px; margin-top:0px;">
                          <span class="spanBlockLevelExample">This is the first span block-level element.</span>
                          <span class="spanBlockLevelExample">This is the second span block-level element.</span>
                          <span class="spanBlockLevelExample">Instead of occurring one after another, these span elements now occur on new lines and occupy the entire width given to them. </span>
                      </p>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo" style="padding-top: 0px; margin-top:0px;">
                          If we add a bit of margin styling via CSS they now look exactly the same as the first example with block-level paragraph elements, with spaces between each one:
                          <br><br>
                          <span class="spanBlockLevelExample_1">Span 1 </span>
                          <span class="spanBlockLevelExample_1">Span 2</span>
                          <span class="spanBlockLevelExample_1">Span 3.</span>
                          <br><br>
                          <b>Note:</b> setting the display property of an element only changes how the element is displayed, NOT what kind of element it is. So, an inline element with 'display: block' is not allowed to have other block elements inside it.
                      </p>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo" style="padding-top: 0px; margin-top:0px;">
                        <u><b style="color:rgb(29, 90, 194)">'display: none' & hiding an element</b></u>
                        <br><br>
                          This value is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without deleting and recreating them. By default the < &#115;cript > tag uses the 'none' value as its default value. See <b><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_display_js" target="_blank">here</a></b> for an example.
                          <br><br>
                          So we can hide an element by applying 'display:none' to an element and the page will displayed as if the element were not there.
                          <br><br>
                          However, applying the property 'visibility:hidden' also hides an element. The difference? This property hides the element but the page is displayed as if it <em>were</em> there, it still effects the layout. See <b><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_display" target="_blank">here</a></b> for an example.
                      </p>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo" style="padding-top: 0px; margin-top:0px;">
                        <u><b style="color:rgb(29, 90, 194)">'display: inline-block'</b></u>
                        <br><br>
                         <b>Note to self:</b> read over this value again <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#using_display_inline-block" target="_blank">HERE.</a>
                        <br><br>
                          Another value to consider with the 'display' property is <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'inline-block'</span>. This is an element with a mix of the 'inline' and 'block' display property values:
                      </p>
                          <ol>
                            <li>
                              <b>Similar to block:</b> we can set the width and height of the element as well as paddings and margins, if we want to.
                             </li>
                             <br>
                             <li>
                              <b>Similar to inline:</b> no line breaks are added by default before/after the element, and other elements can sit next to them (side-by-side).
                             </li>
                          </ol>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                          One common use for display: inline-block is to display list items (by default block-level elements) horizontally instead of vertically.

        <!--* SECTION 16: THE POSITION PROPERTY -->


        <section id="position-property-section">

                  <div class="htmlRowMainOne">
                  <h4> The 'position:' property</h4>
                      <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                          Positioning elements appropriately on the web pages is a necessity for a good layout design. <b>The <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'position:' property</b> allows us to specify the position of an element on our website but without having to use margins and padding. We can choose from a selection of 5 different values: static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky.</b>
                          <br><br>
                          <b>Positioned elements don't participate in the standard HTML document flow but instead specify their position relative to a container element.</b> For example, usually if we edit the padding part of a container, then this change will have an impact on other elements around this element, because it's part of the normal document flow. However, these positioned elements are removed from that flow, allowing them to be moved independently and not have an impact on other elements on our page.
                          <br><br>
                          <b>A positioned element uses the  <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'top:', 'right:', 'bottom:', and 'left:' properties</b> to align itself inside its container, but only once the 'position:' property has been applied.</b> We apply lengths to these properties to position the container, which is typically done in pixels but other lengths can be used too.
                          <br><br>
                          Below is an explanation of each value for this property:
                      </p>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                          <ol>
                            <li>
                                <b>'static' (default):</b> elements positioned this way are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties. <u>They're not positioned in any special way,</u> but are simply positioned according to the normal flow of the page. For example:
                                <br><br>
                                <div class="positionProperty-static"> A div with the 'static' position.</div>
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                              <b>'relative':</b> these elements are <u>positioned relative to its normal position,</u> according to the normal flow of the page, and doesn't effect other HTML elements. So at first the element will be positioned as normal, but by specificizing a length with the following properties: 'top', 'bottom', 'left', 'right', 'z-index' we can move it around relative to that position. For example, the style "left: -30px;" subtracts 30 pixels from the element's original left position, meaning it will move across to the left; the style "left: 50px;" adds 50 pixels to the element's original left position, meaning it will across to the right. Elements with 'position: relative' are often used as containers for 'position: absolute' elements, acting as an anchor point for them.
                              <br><br>
                              <b>Note:</b> a relatively positioned element can be moved and overlap other elements, but it keeps the space originally reserved for it in the normal flow.
                              <br><br>
                              <div class="positionProperty-relative"> A div with the 'relative' position and 'left: -30px;', 'top: 20px;'.</div>
                            <br><br>
                            <li>
                              <b>'fixed':</b> these elements are <u>positioned relative to the browser window, the viewport,</u> meaning it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. It doesn't remain in the natural flow of the page. It can be accurately positioned using the 'top', 'bottom', 'left', 'right', and 'z-index' properties.  A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located. Elements with 'position: fixed' can act as an anchor point for 'position: absolute' elements.
                              <br><br>
                              In order not to have a fixed < div > container effecting this whole page, <b><a href="https://www.dofactory.com/css/editor/positions-fixed" target="_blank">here</a></b> is a simple example showing you the effect of this CSS declaration.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                              <b>'absolute':</b> similar to fixed, these elements are positioned <u>relative to the first parent element that has a position other than static</u> (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).  If no such element is found, it uses the document body being positioned on a page relative to the 'top-left' corner of the browser window, and scrolls with the page (i.e. it disappears). It can be accurately positioned using the 'top', 'bottom', 'left', 'right', and 'z-index' properties. <br>
                              Absolutely positioned elements are completely removed from the document flow, they have no effect whatsoever on nearby elements. However, it can overlap other elements depending on the z-index property value. Also, an absolutely positioned element can have margins, and they do not collapse with any other margins. Because it's positioned, this element itself can act as an anchor point for another element.
                              <br><br>

                                  A div with the 'relative' position of 'left:30px', 'top:20px' and 'height:100px'.

                              <b>'sticky':</b> these elements are positioned <u>relative to the user's scroll position</u>. These elements change between 'relative' and 'fixed' depending on the scroll position. It is positioned 'relative' until a given offset position is met in the viewport (e.g 'top:10px' = as soon as our element is 10px from the top it 'sticks' to the top of the screen at 10px away), then it "sticks" in place (like 'position:fixed') - but only within the parent container; when it reaches the end of the parent container it starts to scroll with the page.

                              <b>Note:</b> Internet Explorer does not support sticky positioning. Safari requires a -webkit- prefix. You must also specify at least one of top, right, bottom or left for sticky positioning to work.

                          <b>Pseudo-elements allow you to select an element and to do something with it without the need to add any additional HTML (such as IDs or classes) or by using Javascript.</b> They are CSS-generated fake elements that are placed on top of already existing HTML elements, allowing us to style the additional fake element but without adding anything to the HTML DOM tree - even though it appears on the web page as if it was.
                          <br><br>
                          Normally they are used to add symbols or images before or after a text and can be useful to add tooltips. <b>The syntax is as follows: <code>"selector::pseudo-element {property:value}"</b></code>.
                          <br><br>
                          These elements <b>need content in order to show up on the page</b> which at a bare minimum we can achieve by creating an empty string ("") or by actually adding in some content. This is why pseudo-elements can't be used with input elements because these don't contain any content.
                          <br><br>
                          <b>Note:</b> Pseudo-elements can be can be combined with HTML classes (e.g. p.intro::first-letter {...}), and multiple pseudo-elements can be applied to the same HTML element simultaneously.

                        <b>Pseudo-classes (aka 'state-selectors) allow us to define a special state of an element, to control an element's behaviour, solely based on the state they're in and without the need for extra HTML code nor Javascript.</b> They increase the interactivity of our web pages.
                        <br><br>
                        Notice that the syntax is almost identical to the pseudo-elements, except here we have one colon instead of two: <b><code>"selector:pseudo-class {property:value}"</b></code>. Also like pseudo-elements, pseudo-classes can be combined with HTML classes (e.g. p.intro::first-letter {...}), and multiple pseudo-elements can be applied to the same HTML element simultaneously.
                        <br><br>
                        There are many different pseudo-classes, with many different effects. Here are the most common ones:

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.g. Unvisited link = olive color: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/" target="_blank" class="anchor-ps-cl_1">www.theguardian.com</a>

                            <br><br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.g. Hovering over a link = green color and different font family: <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.html" target="_blank" class="anchor-ps-cl_3">www.dailymail.co.uk</a>

                        To make these pseudo-classes work perfectly on our links, <u>we must define them in this exact order in our CSS code</u>

                        However, these pseudo-classes don't just apply to links! Here are some more examples:
                      </p>
                      <div class="ps-cl-div-hover">
                        A div with the ':hover' pseudo-class applied to it.
                      </div>
                      <br>
                      <button class="ps-cl-button-focus">
                        ':focus' pseudo-class on a button
                      </button>
                      <br>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        The <b class="propertyBoldTxt">':focus' pseudo-class</b><b> styles the element currently in focus on the page</b>. That is, if you click on the button above it changes color, because it's in focus on the page, but if you click elsewhere it returns back to its original state because now the focus of the page is elsewhere. <b>The main difference between this and the :hover class is that hover is more for someone using a mouse and :focus is more for someone using the keyboard to navigate the webpage. So a good idea is to set both classes simultaneously and style them in the same way.</b>
                        <br><br>
                        We also have the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">':focus-visible' pseudo-class</b><b>which allows us to get rid of, or simply style in another way, the blue outline aronud our elements that is caused when we use the 'tab' key to move through a website</b>. It should always be used together with the :focus pseudo-class, and it only applies when you actually want a visual indicator to help the user see where the focus is. <b><a href="https://codepen.io/geoffgraham/pen/dyOpQOR" target="_blank">Here's an example</a></b> - press the tab key and see what happens.
                        <br><br>
                        We also have the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">':focus-within' pseudo-class</b><b>which selects the parent element if that element contains any children that have the :focus pseudo-class applied to them</b>. <b><a href="https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/RZraBp" target="_blank">Here's an example</a></b> - press the form inputs and see what happens.

                        <p> When you hover over the text, the 'display:' value for this paragraph element changes from 'none' to 'block', and so it appears!</p>

In theory if we put '1' we should say '1st' child and if we put '2' we should say '2nd' child instead of '1th' and '2th', but for all other numbers the 'nth' child spelling logic holds up. Here's an example:
                                <br><br>
                                <div class="div-nth-child-a">

                                      <p> These sentences have <b> bold</b> text, and some <b>more</b>, and then <b> more</b>.</p>

                                CSS code: <code>.div-nth-child <u>b:nth-child(3)</u> {color: green; font-weight: bold;}</code>
                                <br><br>
                                In fact we can write formulas in the brackets of nth-child. For example, 'even', 'odd' or '2n + 1'.
                                'Even' and 'odd' are self-explanatory, but let's understand the last example.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>In our equations 'n' always starts as 0. And each time we are timing the number in front of 'n' by the value of 'n.'</b> So the first time we run this equation or 'expression' we get this: "2n (2xn --> 2x0) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 = 1st element". However, <b>on the next go round 'n' increases in value by 1,</b> so now 'n = 1'. So the second time we run this expression we get this: "2n (2x1) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 = 3rd element". This process continues infinitely. For example:
                                <br><br>
                                <div class="div-nth-child-b">

                        <br><br>
                        Being block elements, normally divs occupy the full width of the web page and don't allow any other elements to sit side-by-side with them. However, by using the 'float:' property we can make it so several divs appear next to each other. If there isn't enough space on the page, the elements are placed on the next line.
                        <br><br>
                        For example, here are three divs with the "float: left" value applied to them:
                        <br>
                        <div></div>

                        <div class="floatdiv fd3">Div 3</div>

                        <mark class="markStyle"> One of the most confusing things about working with the float-based layouts is the collapsing parent.</mark> Parent element don't stretch automatically to accommodate floated elements. So a floated element that's taller than the element containing it will overflow the container. This isn't always obvious though if there's no visable background or borders, but it is important to be aware of and must dealt with to prevent strange layout and cross-browser problem. For example:
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/lib/images/collapsed-parent.jpg" alt="Collapsed Float">
                        <br><br>
                        We can see the < div > element doesn't stretch automatically to accommodate the floated images. This problem can be fixed by applying the CSS ':after' pseudo element together with the 'content:' property (an empty string ("") is enough to satisfy the requirements of this property), as can be seen in the examples <b><a href="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/codelab.php?topic=faq&file=fixing-collapsing-parent-issue" target="_blank">here</a></b> and <b><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_align_clearfix" target="_blank">here</a></b>.

                          'To align' means "to place or arrange things in a straight line". On our web pages being able to align things is of critical importance as it makes our web pages look neat and tidy (making the viewing experience more enjoyable for the user) but also because fundamentally our web page lives inside a box (the web browser) and is made up of boxes (the box model). So being able to arrange these angular boxes in straight lines or in the certain ways is a very useful skill to have.

                          To horizontally center a <b>block element</b> (like a div) <u>you <em>must</em> first define the width</u> of the element, and then <u>set the 'margin:' property</u> (or individually the 'margin-left:' and 'margin-right:' property) <u>to 'auto'</u>. The element will take up the specified width within its container, and the the remaining space will be split equally between the two margins. For example:
                      </p>
                          <div class="alignment-horizontal-center">
                            This div is horizontally centered. <br>
                          </div>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                          We can also see above that the <b>text</b> is centered within the div. This is achieved by using the <u>'text-align:'</u> property with a value of <u>'center'</u>.
                          <br><br>
                          Horizontally centering <b>an image</b> works in the same way as above, only that we need to <u>apply the 'display:' property to the image in order to make it a 'block' element</u>, and then set the width and margins as before.

                        <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt"> Left/Right Align:</b><br>
                          One way we can align our elements to the left or right is by using the <u>'position:absolute'</u> property and value, and then manually adjusting the length measurements to position the element where we want it. For example:
                      </p>
                          <div class="alignment-leftright-position">
                            This div is left aligned using the 'position: absolute' property.
                          </div>
                          <div class="invisible-div">
                            TEXT

                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo" id="para-relative-position">
                          Another way we can align our elements to the left or right is by using the <u>'float:left/right'</u> property and value. Here we don't need to set length measurements. For example:
                      </p>
                          <div class="alignment-leftright-float">
                            This div is right aligned using the 'float: right' property.
                          </div>

                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo" id="para-relative-position">
                          Lastly, we can use the <u>'margin-left:' or 'margin-right:' property</u> to align our elements to the left or right by setting the value as <u>'auto'</u>. Confusingly, 'margin-left: auto' aligns our elements to the right, and the 'margin-right: auto' aligns our elements to the left! In the example below I am aligning a div with text within a container div using these properties:
                          <br><br>
                          <b>Note:</b> 'margin:' does not affect elements 1) without width, or 2) with 100% width.

                          <div class="alignment-leftright-container">
                              <div class="alignment-leftright-marginright">
                                'margin-right:'
                              </div>
                          </div>
                          <div class="alignment-leftright-container">
                            <div class="alignment-leftright-marginleft">
                                'margin-left:'
                            </div>
                          </div>

                        <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt"> Vertical Center Align:</b><br>
                          One way to place our content in the vertical center of an element is to use <u>padding</u>. We set the 'height:' property (which effects our content) to 'auto' and then use the 'padding:' shorthand property (which works in a clockwise direction) to separate the content from the top and bottom borders. For example:
                      </p>
                          <div class="alignment-vertical-center-padding" >
                            This text is vertically centered using the 'padding:' property.
                          </div>

                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo" id="para-relative-position">
                          Another way to achieve the same effect is to use the <u>'line-height:' property</u> with a value that is equal to the 'height:' property. For example:
                      </p>
                          <div class="alignment-vertical-center-lineheight" >
                            The height and line-height of this div are both set to 140px.
                          </div>
                          <br>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo" id="para-relative-position">
                          If the above is not an option for whatever reason, we can also use <u>'transform: translate -50% -50%' in conjunction with the 'position:' and 'left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom' properties</u>. We use the position properties to place our object wherever we want within the container (usually 'top:50%; left:50%') and then use the 'transform:' property to move it into the centre by subtracting our manual positionining. That is, the '-50% -50%' value means the element is positioned 50% from its top and 50% from its left original position, placing it in the centre. For example:
                      </p>
                          <div class="alignment-vertical-center-transform" >
                            <div class="alignment-vertical-center-transform_2"></div>

                          In this above example, we simply have a div within a div, and then the following CSS source code: <br><br>

                          (Light Blue Box) ... {<u>position: relative;</u> background: #dfe7ff; height: 200px; max-width: 300px; argin-left: 3vw;} <br><br>

        <!--* SECTION 21: FLEXBOX -->

                  <div class="htmlRowMainOne">
                  <h4> CSS Flexbox </h4>
                      <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                          Before flexbox web developers relied heavily on the 'float:' and 'position:' properties in order to determine the layout of their webpages. However, these weren't so much designed for this function. Therefore, the flexible box or 'flexbox' was born!
                          <br><br>
                          Normally with other <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'display:' property</span> values we define element layout and positioning in relation to other elements or the normal web page flow. However, <b> with the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'display:flex' value</b> we create a block-level element, a container, whose main purpose is to control how the children <em>inside</em> the container behave.</b> Note, this doesn't include nested children elements which remain unaffected within the flex container.
                          <br><br>
                          Furthermore, normally within our document we can have a multiple dimension layout, setting one element to have 'display: block' and the next to have 'display: inline'. However, <b>flexbox is a one-dimensional content layout model, meaning the content is only displayed in one way</b>; <em>or</em> flexbox children (referred to as '<u>items</u>') are displayed in a row-type fashion (from left to right, next to each other) <em>or</em> in a column-type fashion (from top to bottom, stacked on top of each other). But that's it!
                          <br><br>
                          These items then may <em>automatically</em> expand ('flex') and shrink to fit the available web page space, or adapt to different screen sizes, or prevent overflow etc. <b>Flexbox is especially adept at handling items of different sizes and returning the best layout for those items.</b> Instead of setting rigid dimensions for the browser to follow, with flexbox, we can instead provide flexible boundaries to hint how the content could display. This flexibility means <b>flexbox is a great tool for creating responsive web pages.</b>
                          <br><br>
                          In general <b>flexbox is more appropriate for smaller-scale layouts, for organising sections of a website,</b> whereas CSS Grid (see in the CSS Grid section) is intended for larger scale layouts or indeed whole web pages.
                          <br><br>
                          <b>Some important things to note or bear in mind with flexbox:</b>
                      </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              The 'float:', 'clear:', and 'vertical-align:' properties have <b>no effect on flex items</b>.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                              <b>Margins don't collapse/overlap inside the flexbox,</b> they bump up against each other. That is, it's not the largest margin that determines the space between the elements like what normally happens. It's the combined margin lengths which determine the distance between them.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                              Flexbox items always work along the <b>main-axis (the direction in which the elements are going in)</b> and <b>cross-axis (the axis perpendicular to the main-axis)</b>. Below is an image to help us understand how this flexbox logic works:
                              <br><br>
                              <img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/12ac134bb129d3a276a9c1ed9fd066cf23c9b193f528fd29b2ad1c4cc9d6a172/68747470733a2f2f6373732d747269636b732e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323031382f31312f30302d62617369632d7465726d696e6f6c6f67792e737667" alt="Flexbox Structure" class="Image">
                              <br><br>
                              When the items are set out in a row-type display, the main-axis goes from left to right (horizontal). When the items are set out in a column-type display, all we need to do is rotate the image 90 degrees so the main-axis is pointing downwards because the main-axis now goes from top to bottom, is vertical.
                              <br><br>
                              <b>Note:</b> it's possible to reverse the main-axis direction from 'left to right' and 'top to bottom' to 'right to left' and 'bottom to top' - see 'flex-direction:' property notes.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                              <b>It's possible to change the flexbox container from a block-level element to an inline-block element.</b> All that's required for this is to apply the <b>'display: inline-flex'</b> property meaning the container behaves like an inline block within the document, and the children behave like flex items within the container.
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                  <h4> CSS Grid</h4>
                      <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                          CSS Grid is similar to CSS Flexbox, but is basically the next-level version of it.
                          <br><br>
                          It's similar because we are creating a block-level container via the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'display:' property</b> (this time with a <span class="propertyBoldTxt">value of 'grid'</span>) whose main purpose is to control how its children <em>inside</em> it behave.</b> Again, this doesn't include nested children elements which remained unaffected within the grid container, and again this block-level container can be changed to an inline-block level container by applying the <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'display:inline-grid' value</span>.
                          <br><br>
                          The difference between the two is that <b>grid is a two-dimensional content layout model, meaning the content can be displayed in two directions at the same time. Items can be displayed as rows <em>and</em> as columns simultaneously within the grid container.</b>
                          <br><br>
                          CSS Grid offers page layouts that are supported by all modern browsers, and excels at dividing a page into different major areas and specifying the size, position or layer of these areas. It's similar to an HTML table but allows us to do a lot more than this traditional layout design (e.g. items can overlap each other within a grid container).

                              Smaller-scale layouts, necessarily flexible layouts.

                        *Have later discovered that @media is one of CSS's 'conditional rules'. Here is used to apply styling based on the media queries, IF they're met.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>A media query is a piece of code that constantly 'queries' or evaluates data about the device or devices accessing the web page currently. That is, the "media" form currently accessing the web page (hence the name 'media' query).</b>
                        <br><br>
                        A media query can evaluate all of the following things:
                      </p>
                        <ul class="htmlKeyInfo">
                          <li> device type: 'screen', 'print', 'speech', or 'all'</li>

                          <li> width & height of the <i>viewport</i> (browser window)</li>
                          <br>
                          <li> width and height of the <i>device</i> (screen size of device itself)</li>
                          <br>
                          <li> orientation: landscape or portrait</li>
                          <br>
                          <li> screen resolution</li>
                          <br>
                          <li> color depth</li>

                          <b>Media queries are important for us web developers because they improve user experience and are essential for responsive web design. Media queries allow us to customise our web page presentation based on the specific device accessing the web page, or certain conditions on that device.</b> For example, if the device is a mobile phone, a tablet, a desktop, the browser program viewing the website, the system settings of the device etc.
                          <br><br>
                          <b>Media queries work on a true or false basis.</b> That is, if the condition of the media query is met then its styling code block is applied to our webpage. If the condition is false, then no code block is applied.

                        <li>
                          <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">at-rule:</b> defines the media query and essentially acts as a logical operator, meaning 'if'. That is, 'if' X condition is met, do Y.
                        </li>
                        <br><br>

                          <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">media type:</b> the type of media we want to target. There are several values we can apply here (although 'screen' is the typical one we use):
                          <br><br>
                            <ul>
                              <li><b class="propertyBoldTxt">all (default):</b> Matches all devices. When no media type is specified 'all' is the default or presumed value.</li>
                              <br>
                              <li><b class="propertyBoldTxt">print:</b> Matches documents viewed in print preview mode or any media that breaks the content up into pages intended to print.</li>
                              <br>
                              <li><b class="propertyBoldTxt">screen:</b> Matches devices with a screen.</li>
                              <br>
                              <li><b class="propertyBoldTxt">speech:</b> Matches devices that read the content audibly, such as a screenreader.</li>
                              <br>
                              <b>Note:</b> multiple media types can be used simultaneously, separated by commas.
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <br><br>
                        <li>
                          <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">media feature:</b> now we know the media type we're targeting, we can start defining what features we are trying to match it to. <u>Media features are defined within parentheses.</u> The typical example is to match screens to certain widths where 'screen' is the media type and both min-width and max-width are features with specific values.
                          <br><br>
                          A detailed list of the different media features we can define can be <b><a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/#aa-viewport-page-characteristicss:~:text=Viewport/Page%20Characteristics" target="_blank">found here.</a></b>
                          <br><br>
                          <b>Note: 'min-' values mean <i>including and above X value</i> and the 'max-' values mean <i>up to and including X value</i>.</b> They are constraint conditions. So <code>"@media screen (min-width: 300px) and (max-width: 1000px) {...}"</code> means that X styling will apply to screens/browser windows <i>from</i> 300px <i>up to and including</i> 1000px, but not outside this range. Those are the conditions of this media query.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                          <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">operator:</b> allows us to combine media types with media features and in different ways, making the conditions required for the media query to apply more complicated. There are several values we can apply here:
                          <br><br>
                          <b class="propertyBoldTxt">and</b><br>
                           1) allows us to combine media types and media features together;<br>
                           2) allows us to specify multiple media feature requirements by placing this operator between media features (e.g. screen width ranges). <br><br>
                           E.g: <code>@media screen <u>and</u> (min-width: 481px) <u>and</u> (max-width: 960px) {...}</code>
                          <br><br>
                          <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'or' (commas)</b> <br>
                          the media query becomes a list of queries which will apply if <i>any</i> of the comma separated queries matches.<br><br>
                          E.g: <code>@media (orientation: portrait), (min-width: 3rem) and (max-aspect-ratio: 2/1) {...} = media query will be true if the device has an orientation of portrait OR if the device's viewport has a min-width of 3rem and a max-aspect-ratio of 2/1.</code>
                          <br><br>
                          <b class="propertyBoldTxt">not</b> <br>
                          allows us to apply certain styling for certain devices which do <i>not</i> support or match certain conditions. <b>Note:</b> <br>
                          1) with this operator defining a 'media type' is obligatory<br>
                          2) 'not' only negates one query, not an entire query list (queries separated with commas).</li>
                          <br>
                          E.g: <code>@media <u>not</u> screen and (hover: hover) {...} = code block will apply when the primary pointing device can't hover on elements.</code>
                        </li>
                        <br><br><br>
                        <li>
                          Here are some more examples of simple media queries:
                          <br><br>
                          <code> @media print {...}</code> = styling for print media only
                          <br><br>
                          <code> @media (max-width: 65rem) {...}</code> = styling for all devices that have a display width of 65rem or less
                          <br><br>
                          <code> @media screen and (min-width: 800px) {...}</code> = styling for screen viewports that have a width of 800px or more
                        </li>
                        <br><br>
                        <li>
                          <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">CSS Code:</b> although it's not included in the image, obviously we need to add our CSS code block after the @media query is finished! If we want to target a specific element which has a class or id selector, inside the first set of curly brackets we write the name of this selector, followed by another set of curly brackets, then the different CSS code we want to apply if the given conditions are met.
                        </li>
                      </ul>

                  <h4> CSS Animations: Transitions</h4>
                      <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                          <b>CSS transitions allow you to smoothly 'transition' between two different values for one or multiple properties, animating the changing values over X period of time.</b>
                          <br><br>
                          In technical terms this process of creating "in-between" steps that smoothly transition from one state to another is called "interpolation".
                          <br><br>
                          <b>In order for a transition to work we must specify two things:
                            <br><br>
                            1) a CSS property to target/change </b> (e.g. color, border-radius, width etc)
                            <br><br><b>
                            2) a duration for the transition effect either in seconds or milliseconds**</b>
                            <br><br> <i>
                            *1: If no duration is set, nothing happens becaus the default value is 0. <br>
                            *2: It's best to use milliseconds because Javascript only accepts this value. </i>
                            <br><br><br>
                          <b>Note:</b>
                          <ol class="htmlKeyInfo">
                            <li>Apart from the above two requirements for transitions, all other transition properties are optional.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Not all CSS properties are animatable but, in general, any CSS property that accepts values that are numbers, lengths, percentages, or colors is animatable.</li>
                          </ol>
                      </p>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        <b>Here is a list of our different CSS transition properties and a description of what each one does:</b>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: disclosure-closed;">
                          <li>
                            <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'transition-property:' (obligatory)</b> - specifies the name or names of the CSS property or properties which the transition effect should be applied to. <i>For multiple properties, each property must be separated by a comma.</i>
                            <br><br>
                            <span style="font-size: small;"><b>Note:</b> Not all properties are animatable (as I've learnt the hard way!). Check <b><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties" target="_blank">this list</a></b> to check the property or value you're targeting is animitable if your transition animation isn't working.</span>
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li>
                            <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'transition-duration:' (obligatory)</b> - specifies the number of seconds or milliseconds a transition animation should take to complete. Again, <i>milliseconds is preferred here.</i>
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li>
                            <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'transition-timing-function:'</b> - specifies how the intermediate values of the CSS properties being affected by a transition will be calculated. Essentially, this property effects the visual apperance of the transition: fast? slow? slow then fast? fast then slow? etc.
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li>
                            <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'transition-delay:'</b> - specifies when the transition will start ... after how long a time?
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li>
                            <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'transition:'</b> - the shorthand property which specifies the above four properties together, <i>in the above order</i>. For example, the following in the shorthand form is the same as writing in the longhand form:
                            <br><br>
                            <code>âtransition: width 2s linear 1s;â </code>
                            <br>=<br>
                            <code>
                              "transition-property: width; <br>
                              transition-duration: 2s;<br>
                              transition-timing-function: linear;<br>
                              transition-delay: 1s;"</code>
                              <br><br>
                              <b>Note:</b> if we don't specify a value in the shorthand property, the default value will be used. <b>The default values</b> for the shorthand property are as follows: <b>"all 0s ease 0s".</b> That is, if we don't set a time value here nothing will happen, because the default value is 0!
                          </li>
                          <br>
                        </ul>
                      </p>
                      <hr>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                          <b>So how do we actually apply transition animations to our elements? There are two methods:</b>
                          <br><br>
                          <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">METHOD #1</b>
                          <br><br>
                          <mark class="markStyle">Part 1:</mark><br>
                          We write some CSS styling(s) for an HTML element via the element/class/id selector etc. Within the CSS declaration block we include the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'transition:'</b> or <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'transition-duration:' property</b> and we <em>only</em> apply a time value to our property.
                          <br><br>
                          <mark class="markStyle">Part 2:</mark> <br>
                          We target this same HTML element again, but add a pseudo-class to it such as ':hover', ':focus', or ':active' etc. That is, when this element is in another state. In this new block we include the same properties as before (or at least the ones we want to change in the new element state) and give them the different values they will have after transitioning. <u>By default, without any specific property or properties specified, the browser will try to  transition <em>all</em> properties according to the time-value we gave when the pseudo-class state is activated.</u>
                          <br><br>
                          Here is a live example, with the code written below.

                        Of course the final property that we have for transitions is the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'transition:' shorthand property</b>. It allows us to combine all the individual transition properties together into one <b>in this order: t-property, t-duration, t-timing-function, t-delay</b>. For example:  <code>âtransition: color 500ms ease-in 300ms;â</code>
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Note: by default the values for the shorthand property are "all 0s ease 0s".</b> So, if we don't specify a value in the shorthand property, nothing will happen, because the default transition-duration value is 0! Also, if we don't want 'all' properties to be transitioned (which is preferred), then it's best to name the specific properties we want to target.

                      <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                          CSS Transitions and Animations have a lot in common, and in a lot of ways are similar. However, <b>there are some key differences between CSS transitions and animations:</b>
                      </p>
                          <ol class="htmlKeyInfo">
                            <li> <b>Transitions need to be triggered, animations do not.</b>
                              <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                                That is, we need to apply a state change to an element in order for a transition to take place - transitions are reactive - whereas an animation can start up as soon as we open the website.
                              </p>
                            </li>
                            <li> <b>Transitions are designed to run just one time, animations can loop infinitely.</b>
                              <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                                When triggered, a transition occurs and then finishes. In contrast, an animation can occur over and over again as many times as we desire.
                              </p>
                            </li>
                            <li> <b>Transitions are designed to go from a start point to a finish point over X period of time, whereas animations give us more precise control over the changing of property values, which property values change, and when they occur.</b>
                              <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                                With transitions we can only really control the time it takes for the property values to change from A to B and how they change via applying different values on the bezier curve. In contrast, with animations we have <b>keyframes</b> which allow us to precisely control what properties change and when they change. That is, we can establish intermediary points or 'animation steps' in the animation and change what happens at each point/step.
                              </p>
                            </li>
                            <li> <b>Transitions are more Javascript friendly than animations.</b>
                              <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                                Because transitions are well-defined they are more easy to modify with Javascript code, however, animation keyframes are more difficult and complicated to modify.
                              </p>
                            </li>
                          </ol>
                      <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                        Below we have a visual example of the difference(s) between transitions and animations:

                      <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                        <b>So in general, transitions are better for simple, reactive animations and for when we want to use Javascript to manipulate them, and animations are better when we want more precise control over the animation and what happens within it (or indeed before and after it), and for infinite looping animations.
                        <br><br>
                        We also have to take into consideration that animations that effect width, height and other sizing properties will have an impact on the whole of the webpage and its elements and thus the CSS values for all the other elements. This could cause layout problems or use up a lot of computing power, so it's best to avoid using transitions for sizing property changes, (see the 'Transform' notes below). On the other hand, transitions are usually more website and computing power friendly.</b>

                          So now we understand the difference between CSS transitions and animations, let's look at <b>the essential and differentiating piece of CSS animations: keyframes!</b>
                          <br><br>
                          <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">What are keyframes?</b>
                          <br>
                          <b>They are timestamps, markers on the timeline of a piece of media, that contain information or instructions for what should happen or change to the media in question at that moment on the timeline in which we put them.</b> In this case, they contain instructions for what styles an HTML element will have at certain times.
                          <br><br>
                          We <b>establish keyframes independently</b> from elements and selectors and they <b>only take effect when we link them </b> to said elements and/or selectors.
                          <br><br>
                          Within a keyframe <b>we can write as many 'animation steps' as we like</b> and change any number of properties that we like as well.
                          <br><br><br>
                          <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">How do we create them? </b>
                          <br>
                          This is the <b>keyframe syntax:</b>
                          <br><br>
                          <img src="./images/CSS_Keyframes_Syntax.png" alt="CSS Keyframes Syntax" class="Imagefifty">
                          <br>
                          We have to give our @keyframe a <b>name</b>. This is the keyword we use to link it to our element or selector later.
                          <br><br>
                          Then we write <b>'from'</b> followed by a code block specifying the starting properties and their values, and then <b>'to'</b> followed by a code block which specifies the ending properties and their values.
                          <br><br>
                          If we want to, <b>we can write percentage based timestamps</b> inbetween these values to have more control over the animation. This, or, we can use <em>just</em> percentages for all our timestaps. 'From' is the same as writing '0%' and 'to' as writing '100%'.
                          <br><br>
                          <sup>Here are some real examples</sup>

                          <br><br>
                          <b>Note:</b> We have to explicity state the properties we want to change and their starting values as well as their values as they change along the timestamps. This is to make sure there's no computer-produced error upon the animation's output.

                          <b class="extraNotesBoldTxt">How do we link our keyframes to our elements and selectors?</b>
                          <br>
                          1) By using the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'animation:' shorthand property</b> and writing as the first value the name of our keyframe (e.g. @keyframe <u>my-first-animation</u> {}"), followed by a duration value such as "500ms".
                          <br><br>
                          2) Applying separately the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'animation-name:' property</b> followed by this same keyframe name, and then the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'animation-duration:' property</b> followed by a time value.

                          Now we know what keyframes are, how to make them, and how to apply them to our elements/selectors, let's look at the individual animation properties that we have that allow us to customise our animations and do more things with them:
                      </p>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        <b>Here is a list of our different CSS animations properties and a description of what each one does. These properties are applied <i>directly to</i> the element or CSS selector code block:</b>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: disclosure-closed;">
                          <li>
                            <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'animation-name:' (obligatory)</b> - here the value is the name of the @keyframe we independently established elsewhere in our CSS. This property is obligatory because without it the keyframe code block won't be connected to this element/selector and it won't have any effect upon it.
                          </li>
                          <br>

                            <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'animation-duration:' (obligatory)</b> - like 'transition-duration', this specifies the number of seconds or milliseconds a transition animation should take to complete, <u>the main difference being here that negative values are accepted</u>. Remember, <i>milliseconds</i> is preferred here for Javascript reasons.
                          </li>
                          <br>

                            <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'animation-timing-function:'</b> - like 'transition-timing-function', this specifies how the visual apperance of the transition and uses values like  <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'ease', 'linear', 'step-end'</span> etc. A complete list of the values available for this property can be viewed <b><a href="#ttf-id">here.</a></b>
                          </li>

                            <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'animation-delay:'</b> - like 'transition-delay', this specifies when the animation will start ... after how long a time?

                          <br>

                            <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'animation-iteration-count:'</b> - says how many times we want the animation to run. We can either give numeric value (e.g. 1,2,3 etc) or the keyword 'infinite' meaning the animation will loop continuously forever.
                            <br><br>
                            <span style="font-size: smaller;"><b>Note:</b> once a numerical value iteration-count has finished, we have to refresh the page in order to experience the animation again.</span>

                            <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'animation-direction:'</b> - allows us to control how our animation plays out. The values can be:
                            <br><br>
                            <ul>
                              <li>
                                <span class="propertyBoldTxt">normal (default)</span>: the animation plays from start to finish.

                                <span class="propertyBoldTxt">alternate</span>: the animation plays from start to finish and back to start.
                              </li>
                              <br>

                                <span class="propertyBoldTxt">alternate reverse</span>: the opposite of 'alternate'
                              </li>
                              <br>

                          <br>
                          <li>
                            <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'animation-fill-mode:'</b> - allows us to choose what styles we want to apply to our element/selector after the animation has finished. Normally animations don't have an effect on an element before or after the animation has occurred, but this property can override that! <u>This property is only really used if the iteration-count property is set to a number (meaning the animation at one point finishes)</u>. The values can be:
                            <br><br>
                            <ul>
                              <li>
                                <span class="propertyBoldTxt">none (default)</span>: no styles are applied before or after the animation occurs.
                              </li>
                              <br>
                              <li>
                                <span class="propertyBoldTxt">forwards</span>: when the element has finished animating, it will remain as it looks at the end of the animation (i.e. the style values set by the last keyframe).
                              </li>
                              <br>
                              <li>
                                <span class="propertyBoldTxt">backwards</span>: when the element has finished animating, it will remain as it looks at the beginning of the animation (i.e. the style values set by the first keyframe).
                              </li>
                              <br>
                              <li>
                                <span class="propertyBoldTxt">both</span>: when the element has finished animating it gets the style of wherever it finishes. Usually applied when we are using both the animation-direction and animation-iteration-count properties.
                              </li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li>
                            <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'animation-play-state:'</b> - allows us to play and pause the animation. The default value is  <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'running'</span> and if we set it to <span class="propertyBoldTxt">'paused'</span>, it will pause the animation. <u>This property is most effective when elements/selectors are combined with pseudo-classes.</u> Resuming a paused animation will start the animation from where it left off at the time it was paused, rather than starting over from the beginning of the animation sequence.
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li>
                            <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'animation:'</b> - the shorthand property which specifies the above eight properties together, <i>in the above order</i>. For example, the following in the shorthand form is the same as writing in the longhand form:
                            <br><br>
                            <code>âtransition: nameExample 2000ms ease-in 200ms 5 reverse forwards running;â </code>
                            <br>=<br>
                            <code>
                              "animation-name: nameExample; <br>

                              <br><br>
                              <b>Note:</b> if we don't specify a value in the shorthand property, the default value will be used. The <b>default values for the shorthand property are as follows: "none 0 ease 0 1 normal none running".</b> That is, if we don't set a duration time value here nothing will happen, because the default value is 0!
                              <br><br>
                              <b>Note 2:</b> we can apply multiple animations within one 'animation:' property by separating them with commas.
                          </li>
                          <br>

                  <h4> CSS Animations: Transform (2D) </h4>
                      <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                          The CSS <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'transform:' property</b> is special property because it <b>accepts multiple different types of values of 'methods' within the one property.</b> 'transform:' accepts these four main methods:
                          <ol class="htmlKeyInfo" style="font-weight:bold;">
                            <li>scale</li>
                            <li>rotate</li>
                            <li>translate</li>
                            <li>skew</li>
                          </ol>
                      </p>
                      <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                        What's even more unique about the property is that within these methods are sub-methods, or sub-values, which this same property also accepts. For example, within these main four methods we have all these sub-methods:
                        <ol class="htmlKeyInfo">
                          <li><b>scale:</b> scale( ), scaleX( ), scaleY( ), scale3d( ), scaleZ( )</li>
                          <li><b>rotate:</b> rotate( ), rotate3d( ), rotateX( ), rotateY( ), rotateZ( )</li>
                          <li><b>translate:</b> translate( ), translateX( ), translateY( ), translate3d( ), translateZ( )</li>
                          <li><b>skew:</b> skew( ), skewX, skewY( )</li>
                        </ol>
                      </p>
                      <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                        <b>Transform is better for changing an element's height, width, or page position than the 'animation:' property because, unlike the 'animation:' property, this property <u>doesn't affect other elements on our webpage</u>. That is, an element can grow, shrink, move around our whole page and not have an impact on anything else!</b>
                        <br><br>
                        This also means that our transformed elements will overlap other page elements if our values make them so, similar to 'absolute' positioned elements. However, a difference here is that the 'absolute' positioned elements are removed from the document flow and don't occupy any space on the webpage, whereas transformed elements do (in their original un-transformed position).
                        <br><br>
                        Also, it's very <b>common to see the transform property used in conjunction with the animation properties and keyframes</b> so that an element 'transforms' while in motion.

                          We do this along either the X axis (left-right), the Y axis (up-down), or both. That is, we increase/decrease the width and height of the element.
                          <br><br>
                          <b>Within the brackets we give numerical values like: 0.5, 1, 3 etc which represent a percentage of the original element's size.</b> For example, 0.5 = 50% (half the size), 1 = 100% (the same size) and 2 = 200% (double the size).
                          <br><br>
                          To increase/decrease the element's size in 2D we have three properties:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><b class="propertyBoldTxt">scaleX( ):</b> changes the element's size along the X axis. </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b class="propertyBoldTxt">scaleY( ):</b> changes the element's size along the Y axis.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b class="propertyBoldTxt">scale(X, Y):</b> is the shorthand property for the above two properties. If we just want to alter one value and not the other, all we have to do is write '1' for the value we don't want changing.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        For example:

                        <br><br>
                        <b>The rotate method rotates an element clockwise or anti-clockwise according to a given (singular) degree value.</b>
                        <br><br>
                        As we're just focusing on 2D transformations, we only input <u>one value</u> here: either in 'deg' (degrees) or in 'turn' (turns) where '0.25turn' = '90deg', '0.5turn' = '180deg', '0.75turn' = '270deg', '1turn' = '360deg'. We can also input negative values here. The difference is <b>positive values rotate our element in a clockwise direction, negative values rotate our element in an anti-clockwise direction.</b>
                        <br><br>
                        To rotate an element in 2D we just use one property: <b class="propertyBoldTxt">rotate( ):</b>
                        <br><br>
                        Here are some examples (here I've used the animation properties and keyframes in order to see the rotation taking place, otherwise the boxes would just be upside down from the start and we wouldn't see any change). Hover over them so they take effect:

                      <b>The translate method moves an element from its current position (according to the values given for the X-axis and the Y-axis).</b> That is, either left or right of its current position, or up or down from it current position, or both.
                      <br><br>
                      We can use any of the standard length measurement units here (pixels, em, rem, percentages etc), including negative values, the only difference here is that <b>percentage values 'translate' the element in relation to itself</b>, not to a parent element. That is, 100% = 100% the size of the element.
                      <br><br>
                      To translate an element in 2D we have three properties:

                    <b style="color: crimson;"><u>SKEW</u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>The skew method 'skews' an element. It's like the rotation method but instead of just moving the clock hands (as it were), we are spinning the clock itself around.</b> It's difficult to explain through words and easier to understand looking at examples. In general the skew method is useful for making logos. And like for the rotate method, we use 'deg' (degrees) as the value within the brackets.
                    <br><br>
                    To skew an element in 2D we have three properties:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b class="propertyBoldTxt">skewX( ):</b> skews the element along the X axis by the given angle. </li>

                    <li><b class="propertyBoldTxt">skewY( ):</b> skews the element along the Y axis by the given angle.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b class="propertyBoldTxt">skew(X, Y):</b> skews the element along the X and Y axis by the given angles. If we don't want to alter a value we can simply write '0deg', and if we don't specify the Y value it is presumed to be 0.</li>

                  <b style="color: crimson;"><u>MATRIX</u></b>
                  <br><br>
                  We can combine multiple transformations by separating them with a space. For example: <br>
                  <code>transform: rotate(5deg) scale(1.1, 1.1) translate(-20%, 30px);</code>
                  <br><br>
                  <b>However, we also have the matrix method which combines many of the above 2D transform methods into one.</b>
                  <br><br>
                  The matrix method and its values are written out like this, in this order:
                  <br><br>
                  <b class="propertyBoldTxt">matrix(scaleX( ), skewY( ), skewX( ), scaleY( ), translateX( ), translateY( ))</b>
                  <br><br>
                  However, <b>it's not necessary to write the method names out nor the length unit keywords</b> (e.g. 'deg', 'px', %, turn) in order for this method to work. We can simply write the numbers (in the correct order).
                  <br><br>
                  Here is an example, again using animations and keyframes to demonstrate the effect of the method, with the CSS code <code> "matrix(1, 2, -1, 1, 80, 80)"</code> applied to our element:
                  <br><br>
                  <div class="matrix-div matrix-div--animation">Matrix Box</div>

                            text-decoration: underline;
                            text-align: left;
                            font-size: large;"> Extra Notes</h4>

                      <b class="propertyBoldTxt" id="transform-origin-id">'transform-origin:' property:</b> <br>
                      <b>allows us to define the origin for whatever transformations we have specified in the 'transform:' property.</b> Can only come after the original 'transform:' property has been applied.
                      <br><br>
                      In the image below is a visual representation of this property and the effect it has. In the center we have the default value: 50 50% or 'center center'. For all the other squares we have different values which change the position of the little red box - the origin of the rotation transformation for each othe blue boxes.

                      This property accepts percentage (%) values, length unit values (px) or keyword values like 'top', 'right', 'left', 'center', 'bottom'. The first value is for the X axis and the second value is for the Y axis.

                        In order to make 2D transformations before we used the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'transform:' property</b>, followed by certain methods and values. For 3D animations it's the same.

                        Before this property allowed us to scale, rotate, translate or skew our objects in 2D. Now we can also do these things in <em>in 3D</em> (<u>except for 'skew'</u>) and again without affecting anything else on the page. In order to be able to do this, <b>a new axis is introduced: the Z axis</b>. So now our 'transform:' property operates around these three axes:

                        <br><br>
                        When we rotate an object in 2D, we can either rotate it clockwise or anti-clockwise on our screen using the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'rotate( ) method</b>. When we use the 3D <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'rotateX( )', 'rotateY( )' or 'rotateZ( )' methods</b> we are asking our object to rotate around a particular axis (X, Y, Z). However, <b>simply applying 3D rotation methods to an object won't make it magically appear in 3D on our screen.</b> Instead, our 2D object will just appear smaller and/or more squished.
                        <br><br>
                        For example, in the video below we are using the 3D rotate methods on the green square. But notice that at first the square just looks like it's getting smaller and more squished, it doesn't look like it's in 3D but in 2D. It's only after we add 'perspective' that the square suddenly starts to look like it's 3D. For the Z axis, nothing changes.

                        <b>In order to properly see and appreciate the 3D rotation, or indeed any 3D transformation on our webpage, we need something called <u>perspective</u></b>.
                        <br><br>
                        Before perspective we're just working with a 2D, flat screen, which has an X axis and a Y axis. However, applying the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'perspective:' property</b><b> introduces the Z axis into our screen.</b> That is, we're not dealing with a flat, 2D screen anymore. We have to imagine that the screen suddenly has depth. We have to imagine that our screen extends out towards us. That we can look into it and perceive depth just like when we're in the real world looking across a landscape and towards the horizon. (See the above image showing the three axes again to help visualise this).
                        <br><br>
                        In the 3D world - if we are looking at a landscape - things eventually get smaller and disappear the more distant they get, like looking at a road going into the horizon (see image below). This is because of something called the <b>vanishing point - when things disappear from view the further they are from us.</b>
                        <br><br>
                        <b>So, by applying perspective, by applying a Z axis to our screen, suddenly the objects on our webpage suddenly also have depth and thus a vanishing point, producing a 3D effect.</b>

                        <b>In CSS, when we apply the 'perspective:' property we also have to choose where our perspective is located via the length unit value we give to our property.</b> It can be located further away from the object by giving it a big length unit value (e.g. 500px), or closer to the object by giving it a small length unit value (50px). The different distances we set have interesting impacts on the appearance of the 3D object.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>If we position ourselves close to the object (close to the starting point of the Z axis) the 3D effect is amplified.</b> The part of the object which is closer to us will be  quite wide, and the part of the object further away from us will be noticeably thinner/smaller. Note: a Z axis value of 0 means no 3D effect will be noticed.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>If we position ourselves far away from the object (from the Z axis starting point) the 3D effect is diminished.</b> The part of the object which is closer to us will be wider than the part of the object further away from us, however, the difference will be less noticeable because as we get further away from objects, in general the smaller they get and differences in size are less noticeable.
                        <br><br>
                        The below image demonstrates the impact different distances have on noticing the same 3D effect in CSS.

                        <br><br>
                        <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'perspective:' property</b> = its own property which exists independently and can be applied directly to elements/selectors, typically the parent element to give multiple children the same perspective - <i>but only direct descendant children.</i> That is, applying this property to a parent/container creates a 3D-space in which all the transformed (direct descendant) children elements operate cohesively. The property takes length unit values.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Note:</b> <i>once we have applied perspective to the parent container, it's only then the transformation that we apply to the children elements behaves in a 3D fashion. That is, <u>the transformations of children elements always behave according to the perspective rules of the parent element.</u></i>
                        <br><br>
                        <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'perspective( )' method</b> = is a value set for the 'transform:' property that is applied to individual child elements being transformed, in order to give it its own perspective. This function, like the 'perspective:'' property, also sets a distance between the user and the starting point of the Z axis, but just for this individual element. If used on multiple elements the transformed elements don't line up together because each element has its own perspective, its own vanishing point. It is used in conjunction with the functions rotateX( ), rotate( ), and rotate( ) which always follow the perspective( ) function in order for the effect to work. The function takes length unit values.
                        <br><br><br>
                        For example, notice the difference in the image below. On the left we have the 'perspective:' property applied to the parent container, meaning all the children have the same vanishing point and thus look the same. On the right we have the 'perspective( ) applied to the individual children within the container. Each element has its own unique vanishing point and thus look different.

                        <br><br>
                        Values for the X axis include the keywords 'left', 'center', 'right', a length unit or percentages. If we set the value to 'left' it's as if the viewer stepped to the left, changing the vanishing point accordingly.
                        <br><br>
                        Values for the Y axis are 'top', 'center' and 'bottom'. In the same way, setting the Y axis value to 'top' is as if the viewer has been raised to a higher standpoint.

                        <br><br>
                        We can âchainâ multiple transform methods to the 'transform:' property. But when we do this, there are three very important things to consider:
                      </p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>When <i>rotating</i> an object, its coordinate system is transformed along with the object.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>When <i>translating</i> (moving) an object, it moves relative to its own coordinate system (rather than its parent's coordinates).</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>The order in which these values are written can (and will) change the end result.</li>
                      </ol>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        To underscore how important the order of values is to the transform property, let's take a look at a couple of quick examples. First, a simple two-dimensional (2D) transformation of two squares that both have the same transform values, but declared in a different order:
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="./images/transform-method-orderX.gif" alt="Importance of Transformation Method Order">
                        <br><br>
                        It's the same for rotating the squares on the Y axis:
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="./images/transform-method-orderY.gif" alt="Importance of Transformation Method Order">
                        <br><br>
                        It should be noted that while the order of values is important, we could simply change the values themselves to get the desired result instead of changing the order of the values. For exampleâ¦<br><br>
                        <code>transform: translateX(100px) rotateY(90deg);</code>
                        <br><br>
                        â¦will have the same effect as:
                        <br><br>
                        <code>transform: rotateY(90deg) translateZ(100px);</code>
                        <br><br>
                        That's because in the first line we moved the object on the X axis before rotating it, but in the second line we rotated the object, changed its coordinates, then moved it on the Z axis. Same result, different values.

                        <br><br>
                        <b>Note that transformations all operate with respect to a frame of reference.</b> To best understand this concept, visualize the following scenario:
                        <br><br><i>
                        A train is moving along a railroad. This train is moving north, relative to the Earth.

                        A conductor sits inside the train and tosses an apple. This apple moves up and down, relative to the train. In the train's frame of reference, there is no notion of ânorthâ. With respect to the train, this apple is only moving up and down.
                        <br><br>
                        However, relative to the Earth, the apple is actually moving north and up and down.</i>
                        <br><br>
                        Notice that the frame of reference determines how we describe the apple's motion. In the same way, take the following HTML snippet. We will see that each object's reference frame is its parent object in the Document Object Model (DOM). In other words, for the example below, the parent is analogous to the train, and the child is analogous to the apple.
            <pre><code>

                        Say we translate the parent by 20 pixels to the right and translate the child by 20 pixels upwards:

        <section id="vendor-prefixes-section">

                  <div class="htmlRowMainOne">
                  <h4> Vendor Prefixes</h4>
                      <p class="htmlKeyInfo">
                        CSS vendor prefixes (or simply 'CSS prefixes') <b>are things we add into our CSS code in order to help make sure our CSS features work on as many browsers and devices as possible, i.e., to increase browser compatability.</b>
                        <br><br>
                        This is not all the newer (or even regular) CSS features work on all browsers, especially on older browsers. All browsers have different ways of interpreting and rendering the CSS features and for this reason <b>sometimes CSS prefixes are needed in order to make things work.</b>
                        <br><br>
                        In addition to CSS prefixes, it's also good programming practice to combine our CSS prefix with a simpler, more standard fallback property in the case our newer CSS feature doesn't render. For example, setting just one color value instead of multiple values, having no animations instead of having them.
                      </p>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        <b>We typically want to apply our vendor prefixes last, after we have finished coding up our regular/standard CSS code.</b> So when applying CSS prefixes we write our standard CSS first, for example:
                      </p>
                        <code><pre>
                        element {
                          animation: example 1s ease-out 0.5s infinite both
                        }
                        </pre></code>
                      <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                        <b>Then we write <em>above</em> this standard CSS property the prefix version.</b> We write above the standard CSS property so that the standard version is the last line of code read for this element/selector and is the one the browser defaults to if the prefix versions above it fail. So now our code would look like this:
                      </p>
                        <code><pre>
                        element {
                          -prefix-animation: example 1s ease-out 0.5s infinite both
                          animation: example 1s ease-out 0.5s infinite both
                        }
                        </pre></code>
                        <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                          <b>Here is a list of the different CSS prefixes we can apply in our CSS:
                          <ul>
                            <li>-webkit- â Android, Chrome, IOS, Safari</li>
                            <li>-ms- â Internet Explorer</li>
                            <li>-mox- â Firefox</li>
                            <li>-o- â Opera</li>
                          </ul></b>
                        </p>
                        <p class="htmlExplainerInfo">
                          When adding CSS prefixes to our CSS code, the <b>shorthand properties</b> come into their own. This is because, looking at the 'animation:' property example from before, if we used each individual animation property (e.g. 'animation-duration:', 'animation-name:', 'animation-timing-function:' etc) then we would have to make a prefix copy for each individual property, which would make our CSS code look bloated.
                          <br><br>
                          This is basically all we need to know about vendor prefixes, but below is some very useful additional information that we can use to help us apply and effectively use our vendor prefixes.

                          The <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'resize:' property</b> allows a user to resize an element on our webpage. It can take three values: <span class="propertyBoldTxt">horizontal, vertical, both</span>.

                          However, in order to work it must be used together with the <b class="propertyBoldTxt">'overflow:' property</b> because we might change the size of the element to the point where the text no longer fits within in it - which can simply be given a value of <span class="propertyBoldTxt">auto</span>. For example:
