# My First Website

Not long after starting web development, I tried to create my own, personal website. The idea was to use this website as a place to learn and practice web development and show my journey into it, while at the same actually building something and having something to show for all that effort.

Eventually, the notes section grew too big and cumbersome, plus my skills improved over time enough to know that I could build a newer and better website, and so I decided not to continue with the project. However, it serves as a reminder of how far I've come - especially in comparison to my [current personal website](www.guydavidwhittaker.com). 

Below are some images showcasing what this first website looked like:
