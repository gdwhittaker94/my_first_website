				<p> <b>
					Welcome to my website. I'm a 27 year old English 'guy' called Guy who's living in Spain. I'm currently teaching myself how to do front-end web development.

				<h3 style="margin-top: 25px;"> <u> My Story </u> </h3>
					My story to date is a bit of a strange one! After finishing school I decided do study Social Anthropology at University because I didn't know what else to study or do in that moment, and it seemed very interesting to me.
					<p>
					From there I did a Masters in film-making, hoping to combine this with my previous degree and make anthropological documentaries.
					</p>
					For different reasons that didn't work out and I was back to square one again.
					<p>
					Stuck, I decided to do the 'Camino de Santiago' in Northern Spain. During that experience I got offered a job as an English teacher in an English academy (I know, what are the chances!). I accepted and began a new life in Burgos, northern Spain, at the end of 2018.
					</p>
					However, after 3.5 years of doing that, I realised that teaching English was not for me and started looking around for new work-related ideas.
					<p>
					That's when I stumbled upon programming and decided to give it a shot! I am currently teaching myself how to code and program by using online resources, courses, videos and any other useful resource I find. I plan to use this website to chart my progress and keep track of what I learn.
